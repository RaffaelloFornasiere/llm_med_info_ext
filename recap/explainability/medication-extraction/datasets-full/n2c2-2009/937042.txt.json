On\n11/5/06 , the patient was transferred to M Valley Medical Center where he underwent a cardiac catheterization , which\nrevealed three-vessel disease.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Hypertension.\n2.

Proscar 5 mg orally every night.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vital signs were as follows.\nTemperature 97.1 , heart rate 73 , blood pressure on the right arm\n108/59 , and oxygen saturation 98%. HEENT , PERRLA , dentition\nwithout evidence of infection , no carotid bruits. On chest\nexamination , no incisions. Cardiovascular , regular rate and\nrhythm without murmurs. Respiratory , breath sounds are clear\nbilaterally. On abdominal exam , bilateral inguinal hernia\nincisions and enlarged right groin hematoma from previous cardiac\ncatheterization. On extremities , bilateral lower extremity\nvaricosities. Neuro exam , the patient was alert and oriented\nwithout focal deficits.\nCardiac catheterization performed at An\non 10/28/06 revealed 30% mid RCA occlusion , 40% distal RCA , 90%\nostial OM1 , 90% mid CX , 80% proximal LAD , 99% mid LAD , and 60%\nmid LM. EKG on 2/5/06 showed a normal sinus rhythm at 76 and\nan incomplete right bundle-branch block. A chest x-ray on\n10/28/06 was consistent with congestive heart failure.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's hospital course is as follows by\nsystems.\n1. Neurologic: Agitation and delirium. In the immediate\npostoperative period , the patient was on alcohol drip , given a\npreop history of alcohol use. The patient's neurologic status\nimproved with the patient being more alert during the day ,\nparticularly with family members present. Haldol was used p.r.n.\nfor agitation during the hospital course.\n2. Cardiovascular: On 11/5/06 , the patient was taken to the\noperating room and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x1\nwith LIMA to LAD , with incomplete revascularization due to\ninadequate conduit. The patient tolerated the procedure well and\nafter a period of observation , was transferred to the Cardiac\nSurgery Intensive Care Unit. Subsequently , during the hospital\nstay , the patient was started on beta-blockers and statins.\nLater during the hospital stay , the patient became hypotensive , requiring\nfluid resuscitation and vasopressor administration.\n3. Respiratory: The patient was extubated on postoperative day\ntwo , but he was reintubated for acute respiratory failure later during the day\nwith subsequent re-extubation on 1/14/07 . During the hospital stay ,\nthe patient had two additional re-intubations for acute respiratory failure\nevents , one on 0/7/07 followed by extubation on the next day , on 0/14/07 and\nthe second one on 9/26/07 followed by extubation on 6/24/07 .\n4. GI: It was characterized by nutrition deficiency , although\nthe patient was able to tolerate soft mechanical diet , the intake\nwas limited. The puff tubes were placed multiple times for\nadditional nutrition , but were frequently removed by the patient ,\ngiven the delirium and agitation.\n5. Renal: The patient had good urine output and the electrolyte\nand creatinine levels were closely monitored.\n6. Endocrine: Tight glycemic control was maintained with\nPortland protocol in the immediate postop period and subsequently\nwith subcu insulin. The patient was also on prednisone with the\npreop indications for COPD and given his postop frequent\nbronchospastic events.\n7. Hematologic: The patient was started on aspirin and also on\nPlavix , given the incomplete coronary vascularization.\nHematocrit and platelets were stable.\n8. Infectious disease: The course was complicated by: A )\nSternal wound infection for which the patient underwent\npericardial strip advancement on 0/7/07 and omental flap and\nwound closure on 10/13/07 . The wound was reopened at the bedside\non 10/30/07 by Plastic Surgery due to increased drainage and a\nVAC sponge was placed. Wound cultures were sent and appropriate\nantibiotic treatment was instituted. B ) Pneumonias. Treated\ninitially empirically and subsequently with specific antibiotics\nafter culture results became available. C ) Fever , later in the\nhospital course , the patient experienced fever without\nleukocytosis despite negative cultures. Throughout the hospital\ncourse , Infectious Disease Service and Pulmonary Service were\nconsulted and they followed the patient continuously.\n9. Other: Incidental radiologic finding of a renal mass\nconsistent with renal cell carcinoma.
