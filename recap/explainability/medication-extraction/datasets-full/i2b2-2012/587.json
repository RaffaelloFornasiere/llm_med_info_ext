Gastrointestinal bleed :\nThe patient continued to receive blood transfusions on the floor and serial hematocrits with serial INR checks were drawn .\nAs he was receiving his third unit of packed red blood cells , the patient became tachycardic and short of breath .\nHis temperature raised from 98.6 F. , to 101.0 F.\nHe was shown to have rigors .\nThe transfusion was stopped and the patient was given Tylenol 1 mg with epinephrine , 100 mg of hydrocortisone , 25 mg of Benadryl and Demerol 15 as well as Pepcid .\nHe had emesis times three of 75 cc of coffee ground material .\nThe patient also desaturated to the low 80 s and was started on a non-rebreather mask .\nHis saturations improved quickly on 100% non-rebreather mask within 15 to 20 minutes .\nShortly after his mental status changed ; he became disoriented and euphoric and continued to be in this state for two more hours .\nAfter that period of time , his mental status gradually improved and he continued to receive his blood transfusions requiring a total of ten units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma to reach a hematocrit of 30.0 , which remained stable for the duration of his stay .\nOn admission , the patient was started on high dose proton pump inhibitors for prophylaxis .\nOn Wednesday , 11-25 , an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and was significant for the following findings :\nMedium hiatal hernia , Barrett's esophagus , erosion of the gastroesophageal junction , granularity , erythema and congestion of the antrum in the pre-pyloric region compatible with gastritis .\nErosions in the antrum and pre-pyloric region , granularity , erythema and congestion of the anterior bulb and posterior bulb compatible with duodenitis .\nIt was recommended by Gastroenterology that the patient is to stay off aspirin for at least four to six weeks at discharge to prevent further bleeding .\n2.

After ten units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma transfusions , the patient 's hematocrit remained stable at above 30 .\nHis INR decreased to 1.3 at the time of discharge .\nHe required no blood transfusions for four days prior to discharge .\n4. History of pulmonary embolism likely secondary to frequent flying .\nThe need for further anti-coagulation was discussed with the patient 's attending , Dr. Coleman , and it was decided not to continue anti-coagulation due to increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding .\nThe patient remained symptom free during his stay in the hospital , saturating well in room air .\n5.
