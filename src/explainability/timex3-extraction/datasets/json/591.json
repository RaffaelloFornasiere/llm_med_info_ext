{"text": "\nAdmission Date :\n06/07/2000\nDischarge Date :\n07/02/2000\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nMr. Larsen was a 50-year-old salesman who in 12/26 was noted to have an elevated platelet count of 778,000 .\nHe was found to have CML .\nHe was admitted on 06/07/00 for a matched , unrelated donor bone marrow transplant .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient received his bone marrow transplant on 06/12/00 .\nHis course was then complicated by fevers and neutropenia which were treated with antibiotics and a diffuse erythroderm felt to be a drug reaction .\nOn 06/24/00 the patient was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and some hemoptysis .\nA bronchoscopy was done and there was blood found in the upper airways but no evidence of blood in alveoli so it was not felt to be DAH .\nOn 06/26/00 due to agitation , change in mental status and increased respiratory distress , the patient was intubated .\nIt was felt at that time that the changing mental status and respiratory distress might be due to a combination of medication and worsening mucositis .\nAlthough the patient &apos;s pain and sedation meds were adjusted he continued to be agitated and there was difficulty weaning him off the vent .\nBecause of this continued agitation , a head CT was performed on 07/01/00 and it revealed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage .\nNeurosurgery was consulted but due to the severity of the bleed surgery was not considered an option .\nThe patient gradually lost brain systolic ejection murmur function and was pronounced dead on 07/02/00 .\nDictated By :\nLAYMIE LARSEN , M.D. EM08\nAttending :\nANA V.
