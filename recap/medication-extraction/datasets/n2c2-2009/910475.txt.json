{"text": "RECORD #910475\n138430825 | OHAHC | 06084114 | | 488437 | 10/29/1995 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 7/6/1995 Report Status: Signed\nDischarge Date: 6/20/1995\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. CHEST PAIN , FOR RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL\nINFARCTION\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES\n3. CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION\n4. HYPERTENSION\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old , Spanish\nspeaking woman with multiple cardiac\nrisk factors who presented complaining of unstable chest pain. The\npatient's cardiac risk factors include adult onset diabetes ,\nhypertension , hypercholesterolemia , a positive family history ,\nprevious history of smoking as well as postmenopausal state\nsecondary to hysterectomy 21 years ago and not on estrogen\nreplacement therapy. The patient has a two to three year history\nof exertional angina. Of note , approximately one year ago she\nbegan to have substernal chest pain at rest. The patient states\nthat currently she is having approximately three episodes a day on\naverage. She describes these as substernal chest pressure which\nradiates to her bilateral arms as well as her jaw. She denies any\nassociated shortness of breath but does occasionally note\ndiaphoresis. She denies any nausea or vomiting or palpitations.\nIn July of 1994 the patient underwent an echocardiogram which\nshowed a left atrial size of 4.0 cm and ejection fraction of\napproximately 60% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mild\ntricuspid regurgitation. Since this time she has been followed by\nDr. Maximo Bryum in C&O MEDICAL CENTER Clinic who initiated an antianginal regimen\nwhich resulted in decreased frequency of her symptoms. Of note the\npatient recently stopped taking Aspirin. Her symptoms then\nrecurred. On the 27 of January , 1995 the patient underwent a\nDobutamine MIBBE on which she went 6 minutes and 48 seconds\nreaching a maximal heart rate of 154 , a blood pressure of 172/82.\nThe test showed 2 mm ST depressions diffusely. The MIBBE showed\nmoderate to severe reversible anterior and anteroseptal wall\nischemia. Of note , on the morning of admission the patient was\nseen by her VNA. During her VNA's visit the patient began to have\nher typical anginal symptoms with radiation to her arms and jaw as\nwell as shortness of breath. She denied any diaphoresis or nausea.\nThe patient was given three sublingual Nitroglycerins after her\nprimary M.D. was called and her pain resolved after approximately\n15 minutes. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for a 10 year\nhistory of Insulin dependent diabetes with complications including\nneuropathy and retinopathy. Chronic atrial fibrillation included a\nnormal TSH. Hypertension. Degenerative joint disease.\nGastroesophageal reflux. Status post hysterectomy approximately 21\nyears ago. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. ,\nAxid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.\nwhich the patient recently stopped , Coumadin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,\nDiltiazem 240 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopipd 600\nmg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Insulin , NPH , 75 units sub-q\nq.a.m. , 50 units q.p.m. , Insulin Regular 25 units sub-q q.a.m.\nALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her heart rate was 58 , blood pressure\n141/73 , O-2 saturation 97% on 2 liters ,\nrespiratory rate 16 and unlabored. HEENT exam showed pupils equal\nround and reactive to light. Extraocular movements were intact.\nOropharynx was clear. Mucous membranes were moist. Neck was\nsupple with full range of motion. Jugular venous pressure was\ndifficult to assess secondary to increased soft tissue around the\nneck. Carotids were 2+ and without bruits. Cardiac exam showed an\nirregularly irregular rate and rhythm , a normal S-1 and S-2 , a I/VI\nsystolic ejection murmur noted at the left upper sternal border.\nLungs were clear to auscultation and percussion. Abdomen was soft ,\nnontender , obese with active bowel sounds. Extremities showed a\nright shin scar which was healing well. There was no clubbing or\ncyanosis , no evidence of any femoral bruits. Rectal examination\nwas guaiac negative. On neurologic examination the patient was\nalert and oriented x 2. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact.\nStrength was 5/5 bilaterally. There was decreased sensation to\nlight touch bilaterally in the lower extremities.\nLABORATORY DATA: On admission Sodium 134 , Potassium 4.7 , Chloride\n96 , Bicarb 22 , BUN 28 , Creatinine 1.3 , Blood\nGlucose 472 , Digoxin level 1.0. PT 14.5 , PTT 26. Urinalysis was\nnegative. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 60 with a\nnormal axis. T wave inversions were noted in both leads 3 and F\nand Q waves were noted in V-1 through V-3. Chest x-ray showed no\nevidence of infiltrates or effusions. There was borderline\ncardiomegaly.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to Medicine Team Voone Parkway , Ainggo Ra I , Alaska 89772\nShe was ruled out for myocardial infarction with\nserial CK , MB and EKG's. Heparin was initially started given the\npossibility that this was unstable angina. The Cardiology Team was\nconsulted for recommendations on possible cardiac catheterization.\nOn further review of her history the Cardiology Team decided to\nschedule a cardiac catheterization. This was performed on the 4 of June and showed mildly elevated right sided pressure including a\nright atrial pressure of 15 , an RV pressure of 50/16 with a mean PA\npressure of 32 , pulmonary capillary wedge of 22. The coronary\narteries were noted to be normal and left ventricular function was\nalso assessed as normal. The patient tolerated this procedure well\nand without complications. Given the confluence of her data , two\npossible explanations were postulated including either syndrome X\nor small vessel disease , not noted on cardiac catheterization. The\npatient remained stable , status post cardiac catheterization and\nwas prepared for discharge. Also during her hospital course the\npatient's Insulin dosages were adjusted in the manner to keep her\nblood sugars in the approximately 200 range.\nDISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Enteric Coated Aspirin 325\nmg p.o. q.d.; Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; Lopid 600 mg\np.o. q.d.; Insulin NPH 100 units sub-q q.a.m. , 70 units sub-q\nq.h.s. , Insulin Regular 25 units sub-q q.a.m.; Lisinopril 10 mg\np.o. q.d.; Nitroglycerin 1/150th one tablet sublingual q. 5 minutes\nx 3 p.r.n. chest pain; Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Coumadin 10 mg\np.o. q.h.s.; Diltiazem CD 240 mg p.o. q.d. FOLLOW-UP CARE: The\npatient will follow-up with her primary M.D. , Dr. Jarvis Needy in\nthe RINGBURG RITA'S PROPRES MEMORIAL HOSPITAL Clinic.\nDictated By: DARRON MCCLARIN , M.D. BV80\nAttending: IGNACIO W.
