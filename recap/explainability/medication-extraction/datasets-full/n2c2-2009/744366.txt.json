{"text": "RECORD #744366\n\n\n411326611 | CH | 65470446 | | 403034 | 2/29/1995 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Unsigned | DIS | Admission Date: 3/17/1995 Report Status: Unsigned\n\nDischarge Date: 4/16/1995\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 50 year old man with\nunstable angina who was referred to\nthe Rhalca Medical Center for cardiac catheterization and\ncoronary artery bypass grafting. The patient has a four-year\nhistory of coronary artery disease who presented with left-sided\nchest pain four days prior to admission. He describes episodes of\nchest pain occurring approximately q. two months as well as\nevidence of shortness of breath although he has a noted picture of\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nETT in 1989 was negative and he recently described progressively\npoor exercise tolerance to the point that he was taking sublingual\nNTG on a twice daily basis for exertional angina. One week prior\nto admission he developed severe substernal chest discomfort at\nrest , lasting approximately 10 minutes. Then , after taking a\nsublingual NTG , he reported loss of consciousness for a duration of\n20 to 30 seconds at which point he was taken to the Spena Hospital by\nan EMT. At the clinic he received intravenous NTG , heparin and\nDiltiazem.\nAn ETT Thallium demonstrated reperfusion abnormalities in the\ninferior and anterior walls. He left the Ca Awythe Stosit Memorial Hospital AMA to see\nhis cardiologist on the 11th who referred him to the Troydale Health for elective catheterization. At the time of\npresentation he denied chest pain or shortness of breath. Cardiac\nrisk factors are notably an 80-pack year smoking history , family\nhistory of heart disease , hypercholesterolemia and non\ninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for history of interstitial lung\ndisease , hyperlipidemia , GE reflux , chronic bronchitis and\nobstructive sleep apnea. MEDICATIONS ON ADMIT: Cardizem 120mg\np.o.b.i.d. , Mevacor 20mg p.o.b.i.d. , Pepcid 40mg p.o.q.d. , Ventolin\nand Seldane taken on a prn basis. ALLERGIES: NKDA.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Six centimeters of JVD , normal cardiac\nexamination with intact distal pulses.\nDiminished breath sounds bilaterally.\nLABORATORY EVALUATION: Unremarkable.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology\nService and underwent cardiac catheterization\ndemonstrating 80% distal stenosis of the left main as well as the\norigin of the LAD with additional occlusion of the midportion of\nthe LAD and distal carotid , 80% stenosis of midportion of left\ncircumflex and proximal occlusion of the right coronary. Previous\npulmonary function tests performed in March included an FEV-1 of\n2.53 , FEV-1/FVC of 83 , FVC 3.05. He was seen preoperatively by the\nDental Service. He was felt to have a possible periodontal abscess\nof tooth #32 for which a course of p.o. penicillin was recommended\nand completed.\nOn the 26 of May , the patient received double coronary artery bypass\ngraft including pedicle LIMA bypass to the LAD and LAD patch\nangioplasty with a single aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass graft\nto the obtuse marginal. He tolerated the procedure well. He was\nadmitted to the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit in routine\nfashion without complications. He was stable in sinus rhythm. He\nhad a somewhat higher than normal O2 requirement which diminished\nwith diuresis.\nHis hospital course proceeded without complications although he did\ndemonstrate a low-grade fever and leukocytosis up to 20 , 000 for\nwhich he was started on an empiric course of cefuroxime for\nradiographic infiltrate although his sputum cultures were not\ndefinitive. He was evaluated by the ID Service and cultured\nappropriately with continuation of empiric antibiotics. He\ncontinued to demonstate low-grade fevers during the course of his\nhospital stay with persistent leukocytosis in the range of 14 to\n16K prior to discharge. No definite source of infection was\nidentified.\nAll of his wound sites looked clean and cultures remained negative.\nHe was weaned off oxygen for some time. He had no productive\ncough. On the 24 of September we discharged him to home AMA , although\nencouraged a stay for further evaluation of his fever and\nleukocytosis.\nDISPOSITION: Aspirin 325mg q.d. , Diltiazem 120mg p.o.t.i.d. ,\nColace 100mg t.i.d. , iron sulfate 300mg t.i.d. , Lasix\n80mg p.o.b.i.d. , Mevacor 20mg p.o.b.i.d. , MVI one p.o.q.d. ,\nPercocet one to two tabs. q. 4 prn , KCl 40mil/eq p.o.b.i.d. and\nciprofloxacin 500mg p.o.b.i.d. X 10 days taken with clindamycin\n300mg p.o.q.i.d. He was encouraged to see his cardiologist for\nfollow-up over the following week and should return to\nDr. Donnie Daidone office during this interval prior to completion\nof his antibiotics.\nDictated By: HARLEY C.
