He was admitted to the ICU for\ncareful monitoring and fluid volume management\npostoperatively. He has had multiple abdominal surgeries. The\nmesh was originally placed for ventral hernia repair in 2005. He\nhad since developed draining sinus tracts for which cultures have\ngrown out MRSA. He was admitted preoperatively for reversal of\nanticoagulation and semi-urgent removal of the mesh. In the\noperating room , he underwent an exploratory laparotomy , lysis of\nadhesions and removal of the abdominal mesh. He was closed and\none Jackson-Pratt drain was left in place. During the procedure ,\nhe was intubated with etomidate , succinylcholine and kept sedated\nwith Versed and fentanyl. He received intraoperative vancomycin\nand levofloxacin as well as 2200 mL of lactated Ringer's. In an\nattempt to reverse anticoagulation , one unit of FFP was begun but\nthen aborted due to hypotension , which resolved with epinephrine\ninjection , likely due to transfusion reaction. Another unit of\nFFP was hung and tolerated well. EBL was 300 mL. Urine output\nwas 410 mL for the four-hour case. He was extubated uneventfully\nand transferred to the ICU in stable condition.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Colon cancer , status post colonoscopy in 2005 that was\nnegative.\n2. Prostate cancer.\n3. History of CVA with a left occipital infarct thought to be\ndue to embolic phenomenon.\n4. History of TIAs.\n5. Osteoarthritis of the cervical spine.\n6. Chronic atrial fibrillation , on Coumadin for anticoagulation.\n7. Sick sinus syndrome , status post pacer placement.\n8. CAD status post MI in 2005 , status post stenting of LAD and\nRCA.\n9. CHF.\n10 Spindle-cell tumors from lung.\n11. Hypothyroidism.\n12. MRSA wound infection/mesh infection.\n13. Status post Mallory-Weiss tear.\n14. Hiatal hernia.\n15. Status post debridement of skin and subcutaneous tissue with\npartial excision of mesh and wound vac on 3/25/05\n16. Status post ex lap ventral hernia repair with Sepramesh ,\n3/28/05.\n17. Status post right colectomy in 2002 complicated by fascial\ndehiscence requiring ex lap and repair of fascial dehiscence.\n18. Status post prostatectomy.\n19. Status post right VATS and wedge resection.\n20. Status post fusion of cervical spine.\n21. Status post TNA.\n22. Status post appendectomy.\nOUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:\n1. Amiodarone 200 mg by mouth daily.\n2. Calcium.\n3. Colace 100 mg by mouth t.i.d.\n4. Coumadin alternating doses of 4 mg and 3 mg.\n5. Diltiazem CD 360 mg p.o. daily.\n6. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.\n7. Folate 1 mg p.o. daily.\n8. Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily.\n9. Metamucil p.r.n.\n10. Clopidogrel 75 mg p.o. daily.\n11. Potassium.\n12. Protonix 40 mg p.o. daily.\n13. Simvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily.\n14. Synthroid 25 mcg p.o. daily.\n15. Thiamine 100 mg p.o. daily.\n16. Metoprolol SR 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n17. Zyprexa 2.5 mg at bedtime p.r.n.\nALLERGIES: Ether.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: No alcohol or tobacco use. Married , lives with\nwife , retired 25 years ago.\nADMISSION LABS: Remarkable for creatinine of 1 , hematocrit of\n30.1% , INR of 1.7. EKG V-paced at 60 , no ST-T wave abnormalities\ncompared to preop.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital Signs: On admission , temperature\n98 , pulse 60 and V-paced , blood pressure 140/85 , saturating 96%\non 3 L nasal cannula. Neuro: Awake , alert , appropriate.\nPulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , no rales , no\nwheezes. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs ,\nrubs or gallops. Abdomen: Soft , nondistended , mildly tender\nmidline incision with dressing clean , dry and intact. JP in\nmidline with sanguinous drainage. Lax abdominal wall with\nprotuberance but soft. Extremities: Warm and well perfused.\nIMAGING: Chest x-ray negative for acute disease and\ncardiomegaly.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 90+-year-old gentleman with a complex\npast medical history including CAD status post MI and stent x2 ,\nCHF was admitted to the SICU , status post ex lap for removal of\nMRSA-infected mesh for careful monitoring and fluid resuscitation\nin light of cardiac status. His postoperative course was\nremarkable for bleeding with sanguinous output from the JP drain ,\na question of an abdominal hematoma and a progressive drop in his\nhematocrit. The heparin drip , which was initiated given the\npatient's chronic AF , was discontinued and FFP administered.\nPlatelets were also given at the request of the Plastic Surgery\nTeam in light of aspirin and Plavix , which were continued due to\nthe patient's cardiac stents. Despite bolus Lasix , the patient\ndid develop CHF with symptomatic pulmonary edema and increased\noxygen requirement. Concomitantly , the patient also became\ndelirious , as is his historical pattern with significant agitation.\nHe developed hypertension refractory to beta-blockade , calcium\nchannel blockers and IV ACE inhibitors in this setting. The\npatient was thus placed on a nitroglycerin drip , a furosemide\ndrip with ginger blood product resuscitation to address bleeding\nand an elevated INR. He responded well to this regimen and\naggressive pulmonary toilet. Both the patient's PCP , Dr.\nGillice , and his cardiologist , Dr. Keks , did follow the\npatient. His oxygenation never suffered during this time and he\ndid not have significant hypercarbia. He was eventually weaned\nback to nasal cannula. He did have a mild transient elevation in\ncreatinine while on the Lasix drip but has since recovered back\nto baseline off of the Lasix drip. His nasogastric tube was\nremoved on 9/2/06 and he tolerated ice chips without\ndifficulty. His home cardiac medications were restarted on\n9/28/06. The patient was out of bed and ambulating without\ndifficulty. At the time of dictation , his nitroglycerin drip was\nbeing weaned with the assistance of nitro paste. He is\nanticipated to be transferred to the floor once he receives a red\nblood cell transfusion and once the nitroglycerin drip is off.\nPLAN:\nNeuro:\n1. The patient does sundown at home and has done so while in\nthe ICU. He has been much more calm and appropriate over the\npast 24 to 36 hours.\n2. He does experience more significant delirium with morphine\nand less so with sparing Dilaudid p.r.n.\n3. We will continue with sparing Dilaudid p.r.n. , and Zyprexa\n2.5 at bedtime p.r.n. per home regimen. Haldol is written p.r.n.\nas needed.\nCardiovascular:\n1. CAD status post stent x2 , AF on chronic anticoagulation , CHF ,\nstatus post pacer for sick sinus syndrome , currently V paced.\n2. Outpatient systolic blood pressure 150 to 180 , current goal\nof SBP 140 to 160.\n3. Weaning off nitroglycerin drip , nitro paste added.\n4. Diltiazem CD 360 p.o. daily , Lopressor SR 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,\nlisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily , amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily ,\nrestarted per home regimen.\n5. Aspirin and Plavix to continue for cardiac stents.\n6. Watch for overload.\nPulmonary:\n1. Pulmonary edema with improving chest x-ray , currently\nsaturating well on 4 L of nasal cannula.\n2. Aggressive pulmonary toilet , nebs , out of bed and ambulation.\n3. Lasix with blood.\nGI:\n1. Patient advanced to clear liquids only.\n2. All p.o. meds.\n3. Nexium.\nGU:\n1. Good urine output off Lasix.\n2. Creatinine back to baseline of 1.\n3. Lasix to be given with blood as well as potassium.\n4. Slowly trending back to preop weight , would recommend gentle\ndiuresis p.r.n. and careful observance of potassium.\nHeme:\n1. Hematocrit 25% today , we will give one unit of packed red\nblood cells with Lasix and potassium.\n2. Continue with subcutaneous heparin for now and Coumadin to restart\nat discretion of primary team.\nID:\n1. Vancomycin for MRSA-infected mesh.\n2. PICC line consult ordered for anticipated long-term\nvancomycin.\nEndocrine:\n1. Synthroid at home dose.\n2. RISS.\nSERVICES FOLLOWING THE PATIENT:\n1. Medicine , Dr. Harcar , patient's PCP.\n2. Cardiology , Dr. Pagliari\n3. Plastic Surgery , Dr. Dunshie\nPatient anticipated to be transferred to the floor on 9/28/06.\neScription document: 8-1765940 CSSten Tel\nDictated By: POSSINGER , NICK\nAttending: BERKELEY ,
