The patient has known cardiomyopathy thought to be\nsecondary to alcohol with incomplete cardiology follow up.\nCardiac catheterization performed in 1998 showed a right atrial\npressure of 16 , PA pressure 49 of 28 , pulmonary capillary wedge\npressure of 26 , cardiac output of 4 , cardiac stress done in 2002 ,\nhe lasted 5 minutes 30 seconds did not read anaerobic threshold\nwith a ZO2 of 11.1. The patient was admitted in February 2003 with\ndecompensated heart failure. An echo showed LV EDD of 65 and\nejection fraction of 25% with moderate MR and severe TR treated\nwith dobutamine , seretide , and diuretics with good effect.\nCourse complicated by left leg cellulitis and worsening renal\nfunctioning on ACE inhibitor. Two weeks prior to presentation ,\nthe patient was seen in clinic with fluid retention , diuretics\nwere increased , then had worsening renal function , so diuretics\nwas held and now presented with fatigue , leg edema , and draining\nfoot wound.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nHypertension , diabetes , peripheral vasculare disease , status post\ntransmetatarsal amputations , osteomyelitis , and VT. The patient\ndeclined ICD , gout , occipital CVA , and atrial fibrillation.\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\nDigoxin 0.125 mg q.o.d. , Imdur 30 mg q.d. , hydralazine 25 mg\nt.i.d. , torsemide was being held , Coumadin 1 mg q.d. , carvedilol\n3.125 mg b.i.d. , allopurinol 100 mg q.d. , Glucophage , and\nglyburide.\nFAMILY HISTORY:\nFather with coronary artery disease in 80s.\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\nHe currently lives with a roommate. Family is somewhat strange ,\nalthough recently more involved with the patient. No tobacco use\nand moderate alcohol consumption per patient.\nALLERGIES:\nNo known drug allergies.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nA tired older man lying at 30 degrees with profound fatigue.\nBlood pressure 84/60 , pulse 100 and regular , weight 102.4 kg , and\ntemperature 99.4. Mild pallor. No scleral icterus. JVP to the\nangle of jaw. Coarse breath sounds bilaterally without wheeze.\nCardiac irregular and soft systolic murmur at the left sternal\nborder. No S3 , gallop , or rub. Abdomen reveals decreased bowel\nsounds. Liver - four fingerbreadths below right costal margin ,\nnonpulsatile. No guarding or rebound. Extremities: Warm with 3+\nedema to thighs.\nLABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:\nSodium 129 , potassium 4.2 , BUN 133 , creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit\n31.9 , white blood cell count 15.8 with 89% polys , 8 bands , and\nINR 4.6 , albumin 2.7 and total bilirubin 3.4 , and normal\ntransaminases. ECG showed atrial fibrillation at 90 per minute ,\nlow voltage , poor R-wave progression with QRS widening , and\nnonspecific T-wave abnormality.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\nThe patient was admitted to Cardiology Service for continued\nmanagement of his volume overload , dilated cardiomyopathy , and\nlower extremity infections. This hospital course will be\nsummarized briefly by dates.\n1. On 4/13/03 , the patient was found to have progression of his\nright lower extremity infection and was taken to the OR for\ndebridement.\n2. On 2/19/03 , Diuril was added to his regimen and his\ncreatinine was noted to increase from 2.6 to 3.6 and diuretics\nwere subsequently held.\n3. On 11/30/03 , the patient retuned to the OR for revision of\nright wound infection and underwent a further transmetatarsal\namputation.\n4. On 4/12/03 , the patient noted nausea , fatigue , and malaise\ncoincident with 20-beat run of VT followed by syncope in the\nstetting of dobutamine. The VT terminated spontaneously. The\npatient was loaded on amiodarone , unfortunately still required\nlow dose dobutamine to maintain his cardiac output.\n5. On 3/15/03 , the patient returned to the OR for debridement\nand was noted to be hypotensive with baseline systolic blood\npressures of 80s going to 60s over palp with decrease urine\noutput. He was transferred to the CCU briefly and did well on\nionotropes and diuretics. He was transferred back to the floor\nand continued to have decrease urine output on maximal diuretic\ndoses and ionotropes.\n6. On 6/8/03 , the renal surgery recommended that the dobutamine\nbe stopped in order to enhance renal perfusion and Lasix be\nincreased to 80 mg per hour. The patient promptly developed\ncardiogenic shock with discontinuation of dobutamine and was\nagain transferred to the CCU with systolic blood pressures in the\n60s. He was ashen and cold. Subsequently , he has required\ndobutamine between 1 and 2.5 mcg/kg/minute to maintain his\ncardiac output as well as CVVH for volume management. He has\ntolerated the FL rates between 15 and 200.\n7. On 7/0/03 , the patient noted hoarseness. Otolaryngology\nevaluation demonstrated paralyzed left vocal cords thought to be\nsecondary to left atrial enlargement or potentially the placement\nof a left IJ catheter.\n8. On 2/11/03 , a tunneled catheter was placed for hemodialysis\nand CVVH access with plan initiation of hemodialysis.\n9. On 11/26/03 , he had first course of hemodialysis and he\ntolerated this procedure well. A PICC line was placed. The\npatient was given a pneumococcal vaccine.\n10. Cardiovascular:\na. Pump: The patient with advanced dilated cardiomyopathy with\npoor overall prognosis , was admitted for aggressive diuresis in\norder to improve his position on the ?? ?? curve. This was\nperformed by CVVH and is now being transitioned to hemodialysis.\nHe has beyond less invasive measures such as digoxin and ACE\ninhibitors , and he is now dobutamine dependent.\nb. Ischemia: The patient without any history of ischemic heart\ndisease and no symptoms suggestive of any incorporate lesions.\nc. Rhythm: Chronic AF and occasional ectopy and VT on\ndobutamine , currently loaded on amiodarone without any further\nevents.\n11. Infectious Disease: The patient with chronic osteomylitis ,\ncurrently in a six-week course of ceftazidime , vancomycin ,\nFlagyl , and Diflucan for complicated osteomyelitis , end date is\non 2/30/03. He was given pneumococcal vaccine. He is\nup-to-date on his flu vaccine.\n12. Renal: The patient has had progressive renal failure likely\nsecondary to low flow to the kidneys. This has been exacerbated\nby ACE inhibitors in the past. In addition , increasing doses of\ndiuretics have been ineffective that the patient is able to\nobtain increased amounts of cardiac output. As he comes on\nstrongly through , he may regain some renal function , however , it\nis predicted that he will require hemodialysis for remainder of\nthe life. He has tolerated this. A tunneled catheter was placed\nfor access on 9/2/03.\n13. Vascular: The patient with peripheral vascular disease now\nstatus post transmetatarsal amputation. He remains with a open\nwound in his left foot and a calf ulcer. The patient is planned\nto be evaluated by Plastic Surgery prior to discharge for final\nplans whether a flap or healing by secondary retention.\n14. Psychiatry: The patient is depressed with frequent periods\nof anxiety , exceedingly fearful of dying , and unable to sleep\nwith light off or with drapes pole secondary to believe that if\nhe falls asleep , he will no longer wake up. He was seen by\nPsychiatry , who suggested starting low dose of Zyprexa in the\nevening. This has greatly improved his mood and he is doing well\nfrom this regard.\n15. Endocrine: The patient failed a course of stimulation test\nand was started on hydrocortisone. When this was tapered down ,\nhe had some periods of hypotension and this was increased again.\nHe remains on maintenance doses of hydrocortisone. Etiology of\nhis adrenal insufficieny is unclear. Additionally , the patient\nhas diabetes. He was on oral hypoglycemic as an outpatient ,\nhowever , now this renal function , he has been transitioned over\nto insulin with his standing doses of Lantus with a lispro\nsliding scale.\n16. FEN: The patient was started on TPN for quite severe\nmalnutrition. He now has increasing albumin with increased\nappetite , and he is tolerating more food. He has been placed on\nnectar thick liquids for secondary to left vocal cord paralysis\nand visualized aspiration on barium swallow by ENT.\nDISPOSITION:\nThe patient currently is stable.\nPLAN:\nAt this point , would be discharge with home dobutamine and\nfrequent and careful follow up by his primary cardiologist Dr.\nMongiovi\neScription document: 9-3711468 EMS\nDictated By: KAEDING ,
