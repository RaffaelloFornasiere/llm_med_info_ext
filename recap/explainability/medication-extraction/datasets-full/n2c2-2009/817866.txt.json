BRADYARRHYTHMIA.\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 1. SYNCOPE.\nPROCEDURES: Pacemaker insertion , 4 of October . \nIDENTIFICATION: Sixty year old black female who has a chief\ncomplaint of dizziness and syncope. The source of\nhistory was the patient , who was a moderate historian and the old\nchart. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: According to the patient , she\nfirst presented to the medical system in 1989. At that time she\nwas walking at home and became dizzy. She was taken to Meeville Valley Health in Rhode Island She was told that she had a heart\nattack and was placed on a monitor when she was noted to have an\nepisode of asystole on the monitor. This led to emergent pacer\ninsertion. After pacer placement , the dizziness never recurred\nuntil a few months ago. This led to hospitalization on March , 1994\nat Xas*tu Hospital Medical Center .  She was seen by the pacer service\nwho interrogated her pacer and found it functioning normally.\nHowever , the pacer lead type ( MECHRONIC 4012 ) is felt to have a\nhigh failure rate , necessitating a new pacer insertion.\nUnfortunately , the patient left AMA before the procedure could be\nperformed.\nToday , the patient got out of bed and preceded to the bathroom ,\nwhere she had a normal bowel movement without any symptoms. She\ngot up from the toilet and while walking back to bed became dizzy\nagain. She subsequently passed out for an undetermined time.\nAfter waking up she knew exactly where she was and had no\npost-ictal symptoms. She fell to the floor , but denies any trauma.\nShe also denied urinary/fecal incontinence during this episode.\nShe adamantly denies chest pain , shortness of breath or significant\npalpitations. She presented today to the ER for evaluation.\nMedications on admission - None. No known drug allergies. PAST\nMEDICAL HISTORY: None. HABITS: No tobacco , no alcohol. SOCIAL\nHISTORY: Unemployed , divorced , mother of six children. FAMILY\nHISTORY: Positive for hypertension. No seizure disorder in the\nfamily and her mother and two aunts have pacemakers inserted.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Admission - Morbidly obese black female in\nno acute distress without complaints\npresently. T 98.3 , blood pressure lying down 120/80 , sitting up\n133/82 , heart rate lying down 72 , heart rate sitting up 80 ,\nrespiratory rate is 16 , O2 sat is 98% on room air. HEENT -\nAnicteric.

Costophrenic angles were not\nvisualized well secondary to her large habitus. EKG showed normal\nsinus rhythm at 72 , first degree AV block , PR interval of 0.30 ,\nleft ventricular hypertrophy.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the unit. Her story\nwas most consistent with an arrhythmia induced\nsyncope. Considering her history , it was felt that she certainly\nhad a symptomatic bradycardic episode. Because her current\npacemaker had a very high failure rate , we recommended changing the\npacemaker and the patient agreed. She was placed on the cardiac\nmonitor without any event over her hospital stay.\nAs part of her prepacer work-up , she had a right upper extremity\nvenogram which showed patent vessels on that side. The patient had\na pacemaker insertedon 4 of October in the OR without any complications.\nThe reason it was done in the OR was because of her large size and\nthe strength of the table. After pacer insertion , the patient did\nvery well without any further symptoms of dizziness or syncope. She\nwas discharged to home the following day in good condition.\nDISPOSITION: Discharge medications - Keflex 500 mg q8h for nine\ndoses , Percocet 1-2 p.o. q6h p.r.n. pain.
