He has a past medical history significant for chronic hepatitis B infection and alcohol abuse.\n\nHospital Course:\nUpon admission, Mr. Johnson underwent a comprehensive evaluation, including liver function tests, abdominal ultrasound, and viral hepatitis serology. The results confirmed acute exacerbation of his chronic hepatitis B infection, complicated by alcoholic hepatitis.\n\nDuring his hospital stay, Mr. Johnson was managed with supportive care, including intravenous fluids, antiemetics, and nutritional supplementation. He was closely monitored for signs of hepatic decompensation, including coagulopathy and hepatic encephalopathy.\n\nOn March 24, 2024, Mr. Johnson's condition deteriorated, requiring transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) for advanced monitoring and management. He received empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected bacterial infection and underwent therapeutic paracentesis for symptomatic ascites.\n\nDespite aggressive medical interventions, Mr. Johnson's liver function continued to decline, and he developed hepatic encephalopathy, necessitating initiation of lactulose therapy and close neurologic monitoring.\n\nDischarge Planning:\nAfter eight days of hospitalization, Mr. Johnson's clinical status improved significantly, and he was deemed stable for discharge on March 28, 2024. He was provided with a referral to hepatology for ongoing management of his chronic liver disease and instructions for strict abstinence from alcohol.\n\nWe anticipate a challenging recovery for Mr. Johnson given the severity of his liver disease, and close outpatient follow-up will be essential to optimize his long-term prognosis.",
