{"text": "\nADMISSION DATE :\n03/30/1999\nDISCHARGE DATE :\n09/16/2006\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nThis is a 76 year old white male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who has had several recent admissions to Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital for respiratory insuffiencey most often secondary to pneumonia .\nHe was most recently discharged from Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital on 03/06/99 and was then transferred to Linghs County Medical Center from which he was discharged on 03/20/99 .\nThe patient was doing relatively at home until one day prior to admission he complained discomfort over a suprapubic catheter area .\nThe patient had missed his usual monthly change of his suprapubic catheter and felt discomfort and noticed some blood at the site of the catheter .\nThe patient was brought to the Emergency Room one day prior to admission where he was evaluated by Urology and had his catheter changed .\nThe patient at that time noted slight shortness of breath but was sent home anyway .\nOn the day of admission the patient noticed increasing shortness of breath .\nThe patient was noted to be confused and to be disoriented toward the end of the day after complaining of shortness of breath for most of the day .\nThe patient denies any recent upper respiratory infections , no fevers , no chills , no change in cough , sputum .\nHe also denies any chest pain .\nNo orthopnea .\nNo paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .\nThe patient had been taking his usual medications and using his nasal oxygen at home .\nBy the time the patient arrived at the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room he was in moderate respiratory distress .\nHis initial blood gases on 40% 02 was P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 .\nThe patient was given respiratory therapy in the way of nebulizer treatments in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room because of a longstanding desire by patient and family to refrain from intubation to be considered Do Not Resuscitate .\nThe patient was not intubated .\nHowever he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he received continuous respiratory therapy in theway of Albuterol nebulizers as well as nasal oxygen , intravenous steroids and intravenous antibiotics .\nA chest x-ray in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room showed new changes on his chest x-ray on top of his usual severe bilateral emphysema_____ with scarring in both lungs .\nThere were new air space opacifications in the left apex and the right lower lobe .\nThese were thought to be consistent either with pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was stabilized in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .\nHe stayed in the unit for about one day .\nDuring that period of time he received nebulizer treatments with Albuterol .\nHe was also started on intravenous Ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia .\nHe was diuresed with intravenous Lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2L urine output on the first day and 1.5L the second day .\nAfter one day in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment .\nThis consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous Solu-Medrol .\nAs the patient &apos;s diuresis continued his respiratory status improved .\nA chest x-ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x-ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe .\nThe patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia .\nThe antibiotic chosen was Levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day .\nThis was started on 4/2/99 and should be continued for ten days .\nThe Ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia .\nThe patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2-3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal .\nIt was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then .\nThe patient &apos;s major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with Lasix .\nWhile in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital the patient on 4/4/99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in Cimetidine while in the Intensive Care Unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease .\nThe patient was upgraded to Prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease .\nThe patient did have any nausea , vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding .\nThe patient &apos;s abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to Prilosec .\nWhile in Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently .\nIt is hoped that when he is transferred to a rehab facility that he will continue with physical therapy to regain his strength and regain independence in activities of daily living .\nDiscussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home .\nThey wanted the patient to return to his home after a stay at a rehab facility .\n", "file": "2.xml", "tags":
