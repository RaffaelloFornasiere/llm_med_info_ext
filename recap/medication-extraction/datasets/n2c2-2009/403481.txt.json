The patient has a long-standing history of\nperipheral neuropathy and slight history of peripheral vascular\ndisease. This has been treated thus far by podiatric\ndebridements until the day of admission when the patient\npresented low-grade fevers and chills. The patient also has a\nhistory of diabetes mellitus , hypertension , distant past of\npancreatitis , gout , neuropathy , high cholesterol , and chronic\nrenal insufficiency. He has had a left fourth and fifth toe\namputation before. He has also undergone recent eye surgery of\nunknown origin and had some unknown pancreatic surgery in 1968\nmost likely for phlegmon or some sort of pancreatic condition.\nThe patient was admitted on 4/12/04 with a right plantar surface\nneurotrophic ulcer as well as recent history of low-grade fevers\nand chills.\nThe patient notes that the ulcer came about after some unknown\ntrauma to the foot. He had been followed by podiatrist and had\noutpatient MRI revealing osteo at the fifth metatarsal head and\nthe fourth metatarsal shaft , presented to the Egan Healthcare\nemergency department after having a fever of 101.3 degrees. On\nadmission , the patient had a low-grade fever of 99.7 degrees ,\npulse in the 90s , respiratory rate 16 , and blood pressure 144/67.\nHe was saturating 95% on room air.\nMEDICATIONS:\nAt the time of admission were as follows:\n1. Lantus 100 mg q.p.m.\n2. Humalog 20 units q.p.m.\n3. Humalog sliding scale.\n4. Neurontin 300 mg t.i.d.\n5. Lisinopril 40 mg q.d.\n6. Allopurinol 300 mg q.d.\n7. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.\n8. Zocor 20 mg q.d.\n9. TriCor 50 mg b.i.d.\n10. Atenolol 25 mg q.d.\n11. Eyedrops prednisolone and atropine.\n12. The patient was on iron supplementation.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable findings and/or that the patient\nhad clear breath sounds and regular rate and rhythm. On cardiac\nexamination had a slight murmur 2/6 along the left sternal border\nand otherwise had a obese abdomen. The extremities and back\nrevealed no abnormalities except for a right foot ulcer along the\nfourth and fifth metatarsal distal heads. The patient also had a\nsomewhat cyanotic appearing and somewhat edematous and swollen\nfifth right toe. The patient had decreased sensation bilaterally\nin the feet up to mid shin. The patient also had a known history\nof drug allergies.\nLABORATORY DATA:\nAt the time of admission , the patient's significant labs were as\nfollows , his potassium was 4.3 , BUN was 38 , creatinine was 3.2 ,\nand his blood glucose was 187. His white blood cell count was\n12.6 and hematocrit was 27.8.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\nThe patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service under\nDr. Tosco and was started on vancomycin , levofloxacin , and\nFlagyl. He continued to have low-grade fevers over the course of\nthe next three days. Finally , on hospital day 3 , had a fever of\n103.2. It was decided that at the time of admission , the patient\nwould need to undergo an amputation of the third and fourth toe\nas well as metatarsal heads to remove the infected bone and\nsource of osteomyelitis. On hospital day 3 , the patient was\ntaken to the operating room. It should be noted at that time\nthat the patient's creatinine bumped before his operation from a\nBUN of 39 and a creatinine of 2.1 to a BUN of 59 on hospital day\n3 and a creatinine of 3.9. This occurred coincidentally the day\nafter the patient had several MRIs of is lower extremities to\nbetter understand the vascular supply to his lower extremities.\nTherefore , the patient had contrast dye. Although , this dye was\ngadolinium , which is sued commonly for MRA and is not usually\nassociated with any soft of renal toxicities.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room on hospital day 3 for\na right fourth and fifth toe amputation and nonhealing ulcer\ndebridement. Please refer to the operative note by Dr.\nGuemmer for further details. The patient tolerated the\nprocedure without any problems and the patient control was\nadequate by postoperative day 1. However on postoperative lab\ncheckup , it was see that the patient's creatinine bumped to 4.9\nwith a BUN of 61. This was viewed and was monitored by serial\nBUN and creatinine checks. The following , BUN and creatinine\ncame back at 69 for BUN and 5.2 for creatinine. On postoperative\nday #1 , the patient's creatinine continued to rise and was found\nto be 6.5 with a BUN of 81. At this point , the renal service was\nconsulted for further input as far as possible causes of acute\nrenal failure in the phase of chronic renal insufficiency and\npostoperative period. The patient's vancomycin level came to be\nin the therapeutic range of 30.8. FENa was checked which\nrevealed 0.74% FENa. This was rechecked and revealed a FENa of\n0.97% both , which indicated prerenal failure. Renal team also\nadvised checking for other causes of the patient's anemia as well\nas other causes of the renal failure. Labs have been sent and\nsome are currently pending regarding the C3-C4 and anti-GMB\nantibodies.\nThe patient's creatinine continued to rise despite advanced\nmanagement including with IV resuscitation , fluid volume boluses ,\nand occasional boluses of Lasix. Eventually , the patient's BUN\nand creatinine rose to 94 and 8.3 by postoperative day 2. By the\nfollowing day , however postoperative day 3 , the patient's\ncreatinine and BUN began resolving that BUN of 95 and a\ncreatinine 7.8. However , at the same time , the patient began\nhaving hypoglycemic episodes in response to the Lantus dose that\nhe was getting at home and continue to get here in hospital. It\nwas summarized by the renal team as well as by the surgical\nservice and that the patient may have not been taking his\nmedication at home and now was being his medications , while here\nin the hospital. By postoperative day 4 , the patient continued\nto have dysregulation of his fingerstick blood glucoses ranging\nfrom a high of 367 to a low of 52 where she began to be\nsymptomatic , somewhat somnolent , and groggy.\nThis patient's blood glucose control was evaluated by the\ndiabetes management service and it was summarized by them that\nthe patient's renal insufficiency had a significant role in the\npatient's hypoglycemic episodes and that he ended up having\ninsulin toxicity due to poor creatinine clearance and renal\nfunctioning level. It should be noted that in light of this\npatient's postoperative complications of acute renal failure in\nthe phase of chronic renal failure and chronic renal\ninsufficiency , the patient never required a hemodialysis because\nthe potassium levels remained stable. The high that the patient\nreached was 5.6 of potassium on the same day that he had a\ncreatine of 8.3 , which was on postoperative day #2 , This was\ntreated with kayexalate and along the same lines , the patient's\nmedications were evaluated and it was decided to decrease it to\nb.i.d. dosing and to start holding lisinopril , Neurontin , and\nvancomycin for their possible renal toxic effects. A renal\nultrasound was obtained on postoperative day #1 as well as\nDoppler flow studies. The renal ultrasound revealed normal\nparenchyma with somewhat decreased renal indices indicating some\ndecreased amount of blood flow to their kidneys. At the same\ntime , an MRA of the renal arteries was obtained which revealed no\nstenosis lesions of the kidneys.\nThe patient was eventually started on PhosLo and Ferrlecit as\nwell as Epogen 10 , 000 units q. week at the recommendation of the\nrenal service. This was continued during the duration of the\npatient's stay and should continue in the postoperative\nhospitalization. In light of this postoperative complications ,\nthe creatinine became stable by postoperative day 3 and blood\npressure medications were restarted at previous doses and were\ntitrated to the need that the patient demonstrated by his blood\npressure control. This was eventually attained on atenolol at\n150 mg q.d. However , renal service recommended that the patient\nbe given Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d. This seems to have controlled\nthe patient's blood pressure for the time being. Physical\ntherapy was also involved in evaluating the patient and assisted\nin the management of this patient's care.\nIt should also be noted that a wax sponge was placed on the\npatient's right open wound. This was placed on postoperative day\n#3 , 5/19/04 .  The patient seems to be tolerating this well. The\ndiabetes management service , the physical therapy , and the renal\nteams continued to follow the patient closely during the duration\nof his stay until it was felt that the patient's postoperative\ncomplications and issues including blood glucose control as well\nas renal insufficiency were under control. From an operative\nstandpoint , the patient tolerated the procedure well and it was\ndecided to continue the patient on levofloxacin for a one week\ncourse and the patient is to be discharged to the rehab facility ,\nwhich is the Still Freedral Hospital for their ability to\ncare for wax sponge excellently.\nThe patient was seen by Dr. Ulvan in the renal staff and by the\ndiabetes management service by Dr. Clint Holets , pager #050-61. The\nphysical examination at the time of discharge was unchanged from\nthe previous few days where the patient was seen to have adequate\nDoppler signal in all his pedal pulses , DPs as well as PTs and a\nfaintly palpable right DP and as well as faintly palpable left\nDP.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\nThe patient is to be discharged on the following medications ,\nTylenol 650 to 1000 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. for temperature greater\nthan 101 , allopurinol 100 mg p.o. q.d. , enteric-coated aspirin 81\nmg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , PhosLo 1334 mg p.o.\nq.a.c. , please give with meals , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Epogen\n10 , 000 units delivered subcuticularly q. week starting on Monday ,\nalready given one dose intra hospital stay.
