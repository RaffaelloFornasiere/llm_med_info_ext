Due to her\ndermal ulcers , she developed left ankle osteomyelitis requiring\nbelow-the-knee amputation. She was transferred from Shiredo Sert Of Valley on 3/28/06 in DKA in the setting of a right thigh burn\nand possible infection.\nThe patient was in her usual state of health until three days\nprior to admission when she spilled hot broth on her right thigh\nand developed a painful red bullae. She presented to Path Community Hospital two days prior to admission , but still she had an\ninfection. She was given a prescription for antibiotics , which\nshe did not fill. The area of swelling in her right leg did not\nspread from the original blister area all the way up to her groin\nand grossly became more tender and warm. On the day of\nadmission , she returned to the Threei Cent Hospital Emergency Room\nfor evaluation. Of note , in going to the emergency room , she\nmissed her regular hemodialysis. In the Ingsparks Down Health\nEmergency room , the following vital signs were noted.\nTemperature afebrile , heart rate 60 , blood pressure 150/50 ,\noxygen saturation 95% on room air. WBC 4.3 , hematocrit 38 ,\nsodium 126 , potassium 7.9 , glucose 1221 , anion gap 13 , acetone\nnegative , AST 385 , ALT 127 and alk phos 411. EKG revealed peak Q\nwaves. The patient was given 20 units of IV insulin and then was\nstarted on an insulin drip 8 units per hour. She also received 2\namps of calcium gluconate as well as Kayexalate and albuterol\nnebs. A repeat Chem-7 in the Amoore Medical Center ED showed a glucose of\n1100 and an anion gap of 18 with potassium 5.4. The patient was\ntransferred to the MICU at EH for further management. At the\ntime of her transfer , she noted left-sided headache , a warm\nfeeling over her right thigh. She denied any recent fever ,\nshortness of breath , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting or\ndiarrhea. She did note that her last bowel movement was three\ndays prior to admission.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Poor controlled type 1 diabetes.\n2.

DKA: The patient was stabilized in the MICU on an insulin\ndrip and was then transferred to General Medicine for further\nmanagement. Causes of DKA that were ruled out included the\nfollowing - negative cardiac enzymes , unimpressive pancreatic\nenzymes , unimpressive lactate , normal LFTs. The patient's DKA\nwas presumed to be due to her right thigh cellulitis in the\nsetting of a local burn. She initially was given 500 mL normal\nsaline boluses and then several 250 mL boluses. As she is\naneuric , her boluses were stopped once the blood sugars were\nbelow 500. She initially was placed on insulin drip that was\nthen transitioned to NPH and finally to Lantus 24 units subcu\ndaily. Of note , the patient intermittently refused to take both\nher long-acting and her insulin sliding scale. As a result , an\nendocrinology consult was called. The patient was noted to be\nordering extra food from the kitchen , which could in part explain\nher labile sugars. Despite careful diet and glucose control\nefforts , the patient still had sugars at times to the 500s.\nEndocrinology continues to leave recommendations about AC\nstanding insulin in addition to her NovoLog sliding scale and\nLantus insulin. The patient has a history of gastroparesis and\ntherefore may not tolerate AC insulin very well. The patient's\nnew covering team will continue to follow up with Endocrinology.\n2. Right thigh cellulitis: The patient was placed on Augmentin\nand IV vancomycin. Her area of cellulitis has completely\nresolved at the present time with slight sloughing of the\noverlying skin. The underlying skin is pink with evidence of\ngood granulation and no further evidence of infection. Given\nthat her IV access is very difficult , the patient received some\nvancomycin , as she finishes hemodialysis every other day.\n3. End-stage renal disease: The patient missed her dialysis on\nthe day of admission. Once in the hospital , her potassium was\nvery difficult to control in part due to poor adherence with her\nrenal diet and in part due to her very labile sugars. At times ,\nher potassium would rapidly increase to a level higher than 6.5\nrequiring urgent dialysis. At the present time , the patient has\nbeen dialyzed daily since her admission. She is closely followed\nby renal with plans to continue dialysis while in the hospital.\nShe should not receive any further intravenous fluids unless she\nhas evidence of recurrent DKA , given her anuric state. Should\nshe become acidotic , the patient can be managed with sodium\nbicarbonate and D5W in small boluses.\n4. Cardiovascular: Ischemia , there was no evidence of chest\npain. The patient has showed no EKG signs of ischemia. Her\ncardiac enzymes remained negative. Lipids are pending at the\npresent time. Lipid profile check is pending at the present\ntime. Pump , the patient has a history of CHF with evidence of\nright heart failure likely due to valvular disease in some aspect\nof the diastolic dysfunction given her preserved ejection\nfraction. Her weight on admission was 70 kg. We did not know\nher dry weight. Dialysis is helping to manage her fluids given\nher aneuric status. Her O2 sats remained stable on room air\nthroughout the hospitalization. Her hypertension has been\nsomewhat poorly controlled and for that reason she was continued\non her home dose of Lopressor 25 q.i.d. and switched to\nCaptopril , which we continued to titrate at the present time.\nRhythm , normal sinus rhythm. The patient is currently on\ntelemetry with no signs of arrhythmia.\n5. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: The patient was placed on a\ncardiac , renal and diabetic diet. She was noted to repeatedly\norder extra food from the kitchen supervisor. Nutrition\nendocrinology and nursing staff are all aware and are working\ndiligently to prevent the patient from receiving more than 2000\ncalories per day as specified by her ADA diet. She is continuing\nher Nephrocaps and sevelamer. Prophylaxis , heparin 5000 units\nsubcu t.i.d. - the patient has consistently refused her heparin.\n6. Consent: All interventions require consent from the\npatient's medical guardian , Stanley Paneque ( please see number\nabove ).\n7. Code status: The patient is full code and this has been\nconfirmed with the guardian.\nADDENDUM\nOf note , on the night of 1/26/06 , the patient complained of\nsevere cramping , right lower quadrant pain , which is new. She\nnoted this pain has increased rapidly in the setting of diarrhea.\nSeveral C. diff studies , which were sent recently have been\nnegative and the patient has had no blood in her diarrhea.\nPresumed cause is Augmentin , which has been stopped. The patient\nhas continued to eat freely and is passing diarrhea despite her\ncomplaints of 10/10 severe abdominal pain. A CT scan of her\nabdomen was ordered , but she refused to take oral or IV contrast.\nThe results of this CT scan are pending and will be followed up\nby the new medical team.\neScription document:
