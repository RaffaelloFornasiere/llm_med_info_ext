She underwent a right transmetatarsal amputation in\n1990 and subsequently underwent a right femorla distal saphenous\nvein bypass graft in 1991 which was later revised in 1992. She\nseems to be doing well with the left side until July of this year ,\nat which time she underwent a left superficial femoral artery to\nanterior tibial artery bypass using non-reversed basilic vein\nharvested from the right arm. She , however , had a large great toe\nulcer , possibly attributed to hammertoe , which subsequently\nunderwent a left great toe amputation performed on the 21 of October . After this time , she was discharged to the Nut Hospital in\nAmore Pu , where she was making progress in physical therapy and\nrehabilitation. On the day prior to admission , she was exercising\nwith 4 pound weights on her legs with the physical therapist when\nshe described a cool sensation in her foot. She reported that her\nfoot had been blue , and there were no Dopplerable pulses. Color\nlater returned. The absence of pulses persisted over the course of\nthe night , after which point she was referred back to Largrine Medical Center for evaluation. She denies any significant pain\nor any other complications.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for history of insulin-dependent\ndiabetes , history of coronary artery\ndisease , history of hypertension , cataracts , MRSA from her toe\nwound on the 2 of September .\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Notable for the above , as well as\ndebridements of her toe amputation wound\nsite.\nADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , insulin Lente 12\nunits subcu q p.m. supplemented by sliding\nscale regular insulin scale , Isordil 30 mg t.i.d. , Zestril 5 mg q\nd , Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d. , Axid 150 mg b.i.d. , Ofloxacin 200 mg\np.o. q 12 , Ecotrin 225 mg q d , Vancomycin 1250 mg q 24. She\nreports an allergy to codeine and iodine.\nADMISSION EXAMINATION: Remarkable for the following findings:\nShe was afebrile , heart rate 72 , blood\npressure 140/70. Her right lower extremity was characterized by a\nwell-healed transmetatarsal amputation site. The foot was warm and\npink. The left side , however , was cool in comparison , although\nremained pink with adequate capillary refill. Both femoral pulses\nwere easily palpable , as well as dorsal pedal pulse on the right.\nHer right posterior tibial pulse was additionally biphasic by\nDoppler. On the left , she had a biphasic Doppler graft pulse and\ndorsopedal , although she had no identifiable posterior tibial\npulse. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.\nAdmission labs were likewise unremarkable.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Bulger was admitted and placed on intravenous\nHeparin until the following morning , at which\ntime she proceeded to the Angiography Suite. She was found to have\ntwo 95% stenosis in a long segment of the left SFA and the left\ndistal SFA and anterior tibial vein graft was completely\nthrombosed. She was successfully treated with stent placement and\nreceived heparin and urokinase in the Intensive Care Unit overnight\nwith a turn-over pulses of the left leg Doppler. The following\nday , her stents were removed. During the remainder of the hospital\ncourse , her left foot remained pink and warm. Her wound had an\ninfection of exposed bone , but otherwise appeared to be granulating\nwell. Although left transmetatarsal amputation being considered ,\nit was felt that she had a good chance of healing the wound\nappropriately. She had a single temperature spike , although all\ncultures remained negative. She had continuation of her Heparin\nwhile she was started on a course of Coumadin to reserve patency of\nher graft. The remainder of the hospital course was unremarkable.\nOn the 13 of July , she was discharged back to the Rose-walt Hospital in Coln\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Vancomycin 1250 mg IV q d , Ofloxacin 200\nmg p.o. b.i.d. ( both antibiotics to\ncontinue for an additional two week course ) , Coumadin with target\nINR of 2.0 , last target 1.6 , then received 10 mg in evening x 2.\nAdditionally , Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o. q 4 prn , Colace 100 mg p.o.\nb.i.d. , insulin NPH 10 units subcu b.i.d. , sliding scale insulin\nsubcu q 4 , Isordil 30 mg t.i.d. , Zestril 5 mg q d , Lopressor 50 mg\nb.i.d. , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
