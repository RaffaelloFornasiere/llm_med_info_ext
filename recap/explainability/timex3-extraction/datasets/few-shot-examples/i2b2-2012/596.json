{"text": "\nADMISSION DATE :\n10/19/93\nDISCHARGE DATE :\n10/25/93\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nMrs. Dua is a 34 year old white female with an unclear history of hypertension for at least five years .\nShe was in her usual state of health until around 12:40 on October 19 , when while on the phone , started to have difficulty in talking .\nHer speech became slurred , this was followed a few seconds after by weakness and numbness of her arm and leg .\nShe did not complain of headache , diplopia , or any other neurological symptoms .\nShe was seen at A Memorial Hospital where her blood pressure was measured at 240/120 and was found to have a mild left hemiparesis .\nShe was then transferred to Ro Woodma Healthcare for further management .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nGiven the localization of the hematoma and the history of hypertension , the most likely cause for Mrs. Dua &apos;s cerebellar hemorrhage is hypertension .\nA magnetic resonance imaging study will be scheduled as an outpatient in three months to rule out a small vascular malformation if responsible for the hemorrhage .\nAt the time of discharge , Mrs. Dua has had a remarkable recovery .\nShe is now able to walk fitfully and use her left hand with no problem .\nThe exam is remarkable for a mild leftsided face , arm and leg weakness and sensory deficit that should further improve with physical therapy and occupational therapy help .\nShe will be followed by the OT / PT dept. for that .\nHer hypertension was difficult to manage initially and required three days of Intensive Care Unit with A-line and Nipride intravenously .\nIt was finally under control with high doses of Captopril , Nifedipine , and hydrochlorothiazide .\nThe workup to rule out secondary cause of hypertension given the patient &apos;s young age and the difficulty controlling the blood pressure was started as an inpatient and will be completed by Dr. ______________as an outpatient .\nSo far no secondary causes of hypertension were identified but causes like lymphocytic ? chromocytoma or renal artery stenosis have not been ruled out yet .\n", "file": "596.xml", "annotations": [{"date_value": "1993-10-19", "line": 2, "text": "10/19/93"}, {"date_value": "1993-10-25", "line": 4, "text": "10/25/93"}]}
