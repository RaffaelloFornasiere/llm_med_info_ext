{"text": "RECORD #852130\n844726908 | IHC | 54526162 | | 6224708 | 2/15/2006 12:00:00 AM | ATRIAL FIBRILLATION | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 1/3/2006 Report Status: Signed\nDischarge Date: 10/26/2006\nATTENDING: PAWELEK , BENTON FREDERIC MD\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64-year-old male\nwith a history of coronary artery disease , CHF , EF of 15% status\npost AVR , history of NSTEMI initially presenting to outside\nhospital on 0/9/06 with chief complaint of shortness of breath ,\nfound to be volume overloaded with a clinical exam and laboratory\nfindings consistent with heart failure. The patient was found to\nhave a BNP of 747 as well as a troponin I of 0.43. A repeat echo\nat that time revealed an EF of 15% , down from a previous EF of 25\nto 35% with a functional aortic valve , moderate-to-severe mitral\ninsufficiency. A persantine MIBI demonstrated left ventricular\nenlargement and three-vessel disease with ischemia in the mid\ndistal LAD and left circ territory as well as a fixed inferior\nwall defect consistent with a right coronary artery infarct. The\npatient was diuresed , started on Carvedilol and improved.\nTroponins trended down. The patient continued to have frequent\nruns of ectopy and SVT. The patient was placed on a heparin drip\nand transferred to the Acbroadl Hospital for\ncatheterization and possible percutaneous intervention. On\nadmission , the patient reported to be feeling much better , denied\nshortness of breath or chest pain. The patient reports\nprogressive dyspnea on exertion over the past several months ,\ninability to lay flat , positive orthopnea and PND , reports\nability to climb two flights of stairs , also reports occasional\npalpitations. No fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting , constipation ,\ndiarrhea , bright red blood per rectum or pedal edema. The\npatient reports poor compliance with diabetes management , denies\ndietary indiscretion , reports medical compliance.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes coronary artery disease status\npost CABG in 1994 , coronary artery disease , CHF , cardiomyopathy ,\nnon-ST-wave MI , status post aortic valve replacement with St.\nJude's valve , hyperlipidemia , diabetes , anxiety.\nALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include aspirin 81 , lisinopril 20 ,\nPlavix 75 , verapamil 240 sustained release , gemfibrozil 600\nb.i.d. , nystatin 500 b.i.d. , Paxil 20 daily , glipizide 10 daily ,\nCoumadin 4 prior to admission to outside hospital , Carvedilol\n6.25 daily , heparin drip and spironolactone.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient currently uses tobacco. No alcohol\nuse. The patient is retired , lives with wife in Lin Con , teaches\ngraduate courses.\nFAMILY HISTORY: The patient denies a family history of coronary\nartery disease , however , there is hypertension and\ncerebrovascular disease in his family.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was afebrile ,\nheart rate 58 , BP 124/60 , respiratory rate of 20 , saturating 98%\non 2 L. The patient was in no acute distress , lying flat ,\nspeaking in full sentences. Mucous membranes moist , oropharynx\nclear. JVP 12 with bibasilar crackles , left greater than right\nand expiratory wheeze with long , pronounced expiratory phase.\nHeart , S1 , S2 , prosthetic S2. No murmurs , gallops or rubs\nappreciated. Abdomen soft , nontender and nondistended with\npositive bowel sounds. Extremities are without edema. DP\nintact. Feet are cool but well perfused. Skin warm , dry and\nintact , no rashes. The patient is alert and oriented x3.\nLABORATORY DATA: Labs notable for creatinine of 1 , hematocrit of\n39.5 , platelets of 113 , cholesterol 157 , triglycerides 76 , HDL\n32 , LDL 110 , hemoglobin A1c 6.3 , TSH 1.9. EKG , sinus rhythm ,\nleft bundle branch block with multiple PVCs , a widened QRS of\nduration of 190 milliseconds. Chest x-ray , cardiomegaly\nconsistent with mild interstitial edema.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: In summary , this is a 64-year-old male with a\nhistory of coronary artery disease status post CABG and NSTEMI ,\nCHF with a known EF of 15% , status post aortic valve replacement ,\npresenting through an outside hospital with CHF exacerbation\nlikely secondary to ischemia.\n1. Cardiovascular:\nIschemia: No evidence of ongoing ischemia on admission.\nElevated troponin at outside hospital trended down possibly\nsecondary to NSTEMI prior to admission versus demand. The\npatient was continued on aspirin , Plavix , beta-blocker and ACE\ninhibitor , which were titrated to effect. The patient was\nstarted on a statin and continued on Niaspan , left heart cath\nrevealed occluded graft and 2+ aortic insufficiency with 100% LAD\nstenosis , 70% diagonal 1 , 90% circumflex , 45% RCA and 100%\neffused LIMA graft to circumflex and a 100% effused SVG graft to\nLAD. The patient is now status post stenting the OM V1 and LAD.\nThe patient has remained asymptomatic and shortness of breath has\nimproved.\nPump: EF 15% on repeat echo with severe MR. The patient was\ncontinued on spironolactone. The patient continued to be\ndiuresed initially and is now euvolemic. He will need a repeat\necho in three months to evaluate his ejection fraction and\ndetermine the utility of an AICD placement.\nRhythm: We held verapamil secondary to double AV nodal blockade.\nHowever , with the patient's history of widened QRS and multiple\nPVCs and SVT , the patient will follow up with EP to assess the\nutility of AICD.\n2. Respiratory: The patient has no acute issues. Shortness of\nbreath has improved. Continues to complain of residual shortness\nof breath while lying flat on his left side.\n3. Renal: Creatinine has been stable at baseline. We will\nclosely follow status post chat. The patient was pretreated with\nbicarbonate and Mucomyst. Creatinine remained stable.\n4. GI: LFTs are mildly increased likely secondary to right\nheart failure.\n5. Heme: The patient's hematocrit was 39 on admission. It\ntrended down status post cath likely secondary to blood loss\ngiven the long case and hemodilution; however , hematocrit fell to\n38 concerning for retroperitoneal bleed. Despite patient\nremaining hemodynamically stable and groin without evidence of\nhematoma , the patient underwent a CT scan , which was negative.\nHis hematocrit was stabilized. He was not transfused , as he was\nasymptomatic and recently revascularized. The patient was noted\nto be guaiac positive without evidence of gross bleeding , thus\nwill need outpatient follow-up and colonoscopy. The patient\ncontinues his heparin-bridged Coumadin with a goal of INR 2 to 3.\nIn addition , the patient suffers from long-term\nthrombocytopenia. His platelet count was 113 on admission.\nReview of records revealed thrombocytopenia on previous admission\nto Norpid Memorial Hospital as well as on presentation to outside hospital prior\nto heparinization , thus low suspicion for HIT. The patient's\nplatelet level remained stable. He should consider outpatient\nevaluation by Hematology.\n6. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes on oral\nhypoglycemics , which were discontinued on admission. The patient\nwas controlled with regular insulin and placed back on his oral\nhypoglycemics prior to discontinuing. A1c was within normal\nlimits.\n7. ID: No acute issues.\n8. Psych: History of anxiety , on Paxil and Ativan.\n9. FEN: The patient was maintained on a cardiac diet.\n10. Prophylaxis: The patient was encouraged to stop smoking.\nHe was maintained on a nicotine patch during his hospital stay ,\nwhich he tolerated well. He will be discharged with a\nprescription for the nicotine patch as well.\nDISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is to follow up with PCP and\nCardiology as well as EP. Patient encouraged to check his daily\nweights and report a weight increase of more than 2 pounds daily\nor 3 pounds a week to his PCP. The patient will also follow up\nwith INR checks as an outpatient.\nDISCHARGE APPOINTMENTS: With his PCP , Dr. Qin , telephone\n044-133-1576 , on 0/16/06 at 1:45 , Cardiology with Dr.\nMccoyle at 372-301-7202 on 11/21/06 at 3:15 and with\nElectrophysiology , Dr. Kunich on 11/10/06 at 10:20. The patient\nshould arrange to have his INR drawn on 6/21/06 and follow-up\nINRs to be drawn every seven days. INRs will be followed by his\nPCP.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1. Aspirin 325 p.o. daily.\n2. Lisinopril 4 mg p.o. daily.\n3. Nicotine patch 14 mg per day topical.\n4. Spironolactone 25 mg p.o. daily.\n5. Paxil 25 mg p.o. daily.\n6. Atorvastatin 80 mg daily.\n7. Niaspan 0.5 gm p.o. twice daily.\n8. Carvedilol 12.5 mg p.o. twice daily.\n9. Plavix 75 mg daily.\n10. Gemfibrozil 900 mg p.o. twice daily.\n11.
