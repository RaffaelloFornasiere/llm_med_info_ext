{"text": "\nADMISSION DATE :\n01/25/97\nDISCHARGE DATE :\n01/30/97\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nThe patient is a 70-year-old female with cryptogenic cirrhosis .\nShe has a history of esophageal varices and a history of an Upper GI bleed .\nShe has had one pervious episode of variceal bleeding with an unclear date .\nHowever she is followed by a Dr. Joasscchird at Vaila Medical Center .\nShe was in her usual state of health until one day prior to admission when she felt increasing fatigue , nausea and vomiting productive of bright red blood and coffee ground emesis .\nShe also had some black , tarry stool in her colostomy bag .\nAt Vaila Medical Center , she had a hematocrit of 25 and was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells .\nShe had an upper endoscopy at Va Sit Namar Healthcare showing an esophagus filled with clots and small amount of bleeding varices , clot in the stomach with antral gastritis , and a normal duodenum .\nShe was started on Pitressin , a Blakemore tube was inserted .\nShe was transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Intensive Care Unit where on January 25 in the morning her hematocrit was found to be 27.4 .\nShe was transfused another 2 units of packed red blood cells over the course of the day and her hematocrit improved to 29.4 and then 31.2 .\nThe GI service was consulted and an upper endoscopy study showed grade III varices with no active bleeding and a clean base gastric ulcer possibly secondary to the Blakemore tube .\nHer varices had stigmata of recent bleeding , were banded successfully .\nafter the procedure and 2 more units of packed red blood cells , the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit was stable at 31.2 .\nAt that time she was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to Coden 2 for the Lemgarson Hospital service .\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\nAs described above the patient was transfused an additional 2 units in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient also received an upper endoscopy study and her varices were banded .\nOn transfer to the Lemgarson Hospital service , her hematocrit was 31.2 , white count 11.1 and a platelet count 80 .\nHer PT was 13.1 , PTT 26.7 .\nThe rest of her labs were unremarkable .\nShe was watched very closely while on the floor .\nShe was on GI bleed precautions at all times , was too large for IV .\nShe had a clot at the blood bank and she had BID hematocrits checked .\nShe was kept NPO until January 26 when she began to feel hungry .\nAt that time clear liquids were started .\nAll of her stools were guaiaced .\nShe also began Nadolol 40 mg QD to reduce her portal hypertension .\nThe GI consult team continued to follow her .\nWe also tried to contact her physician at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and was unsuccessful .\nTherefore we decided to work up her cirrhosis .\nShe was described as having _______ cirrhosis and we decided that we wanted to try to figure out the etiology .\nHer ferritin and iron studies did not reveal any evidence of hemochromatosis and her hep serologies were all negative .\nShe also had negative antimitochondrial antibody and she also had no evidence of ceruloplasmin .\nOver the course of her admission were also sent an alpha-1-antitrypsin , which was negative .\nShe did very well over the course of her admission with no evidence of further bleeding .\nHer hematocrit stayed stable at approximately 32 .\nWe also did an ultrasound guided paracentesis .\nThe peritoneal fluid showed a glucose of 244 , total protein 0.8 and a albumin of 0.5 , globulin 0.3 , amylase 16 , LDH of 51 .\nThe serum albumin gradient was 1.8 consistent with portal hypertension .\nThe cell count showed a white blood cell count of 160 with 16% polys .\nShe therefore _________ criteria for a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis .\nHer platelet count stayed persistently low and we decided that it might be due to Cimetidine .\nTherefore we switched her Cimetidine to Prilosec .\nBy the 2th the patient was feeling very well and desired to transfer or discharge to home .\nShe wanted to be closer to North Dakota .\nAfter discussion with her private physician , Dr. Joasscchird , tel. 090-249-6079 , at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and Dr. Acrookesjo at Do Of Hospital , the patient was judged to be fit for discharge and she was sent home with AH and physical therapy .\nShe was quite able to climb stairs on her own in the hospital .\nShe is to follow up with Dr. Acrookesjo in one week and Dr. Work the gastrointestinal fellow here at PUOMC in 2 weeks .\nShe may require a repeat upper endoscopy study to see if she needs any rebanding .\nThe patient however complained of a persistent wheeze with beta blocker , therefore it was agreed that we would stop the beta blocker until the patient was followed up as an outpatient .\n", "file": "521.xml", "tags": [{"val": "1997-01-26", "line": 29, "text": "January 26"}, {"val": "1997-01-25", "line": 2, "text": "01/25/97"}, {"val": "1997-01-29", "line": 49,
