{"text": "**Patient Discharge Summary**\n\nPatient: Emma Wilson  \nAge: 60  \nAdmission Date: June 12, 2024  \nDischarge Date: 06-20-24  \n\n---\n\nDear Dr. Johnson,\n\nI am writing to inform you of the discharge of Ms. Emma Wilson, a 60-year-old female who was admitted to our hospital on June 12, 2024. Ms. Wilson presented with complaints of progressive weakness, fatigue, and dizziness.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, Ms. Wilson underwent a series of diagnostic tests, including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests. The findings revealed evidence of severe iron-deficiency anemia secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nOn June 14, 2024, Ms. Wilson underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy, which identified a bleeding gastric ulcer and colonic polyps. Endoscopic interventions were performed to achieve hemostasis and remove the polyps.\n\nThroughout her hospital stay, Ms. Wilson received blood transfusions, intravenous iron supplementation, and proton pump inhibitors to correct her anemia and prevent further bleeding. She was closely monitored for hemodynamic stability and gastrointestinal complications.\n\nAfter eight days of hospitalization, Ms. Wilson's hemoglobin stabilized, and she was discharged home on June 20, 2024. She was provided with a prescription for oral iron supplementation, dietary recommendations to promote iron absorption, and instructions for follow-up with gastroenterology for surveillance colonoscopy.\n\nWe anticipate a favorable recovery for Ms. Wilson and recommend ongoing monitoring to prevent recurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Physician's Signature]  \nDr. Samantha Johnson  \nGastroenterologist  ", "annotations": [{"text": "June 12, 2024", "date_value": "2024-06-12"}, {"text": "06-20-24", "date_value": "2024-06-20"}, {"text": "eight days", "date_value": "2024-06-20"}, {"text": "on June 20, 2024", "date_value": "2024-06-20"}, {"text": "during her hospitalization", "date_value": "2024-06-20"}, {"text": "after eight days", "date_value": "2024-06-20"}]}
