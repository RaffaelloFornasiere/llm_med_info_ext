{"text": "\nADMISSION DATE :\n2-5-94\nDISCHARGE DATE :\n4-2-94\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nThe patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .\nThe patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\nA barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\nHer steroids were weaned .\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\nShe remained in a coma .\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 &apos;s .\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\nDiscussions were held with the patient &apos;s family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\n", "file": "408.xml", "tags": [{"val": "1993-12", "line": 12, "text": "December of 1993"}, {"val": "1994-04-02", "line": 4,
