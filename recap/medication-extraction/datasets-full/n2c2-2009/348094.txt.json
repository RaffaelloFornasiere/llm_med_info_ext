HIT screen came back positive.\nHematology , following recommended vascular consult for blue\nfingers and toes. If color on extremities does not improve on\nargatroban , will get vascular to see. So far color in right hand\nlooks better. Left fingers and toes bilaterally , no worse , no\nbetter. Respiratory status worsens , consider CT angiogram with\ncontrast to rule out PE with Mucomyst given creatinine of 2.1.\nBlood cultures sent for white count. The patient with left chest\neffusion , will get chest ultrasound once stable , still has wires\nin and being externally paced at 70 until internal PPM can have\nbattery change. 9/15/05 , postop day #9 , HIT positive with\nworsening clinical syndrome.
