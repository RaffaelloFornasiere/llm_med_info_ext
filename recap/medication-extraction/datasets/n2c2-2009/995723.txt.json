Her husband\nnoted her getting pale and rolling her eyes back , states that this\nlasted approximately 13 seconds. She had no symptoms afterwards.\nA few months prior to this , the patient reports having had slurred\nspeech for a few minutes. More recently , she has had several\nepisodes of skipped heart beats during and after which she feels\nshort of breath. These episodes last a few minutes and are\nsometimes relieved by sitting up. The mostly happen at night. She\nhad one episode of rapid heart rate last week which was also\nassociated with shortness of breath.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No fevers , no bowel changes , no urinary\nchanges , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal\nnocturnal dyspnea , and no orthopnea.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.

Cataracts.\nALLERGIES: Erythromycin , which causes hives , Benadryl , which\ncauses hives , Penicillin , which causes a rash , and\nDramamine which causes hives.\nMEDICATIONS: 1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day. 2. Prilosec 20 mg\np.o. q. day. 3. Simvastatin 40 mg p.o. q. day. 4. Cyclosporine\n125 mg p.o. in the morning and 100 mg p.o. in the afternoon. 5.\nInsulin sliding scale. 6. Lasix 60 mg p.o. q. day. 7. Atenolol\n75 mg p.o. q. day. 8. Prednisone 5 mg p.o. on even days , 10 mg\np.o. on odd days. 9. Cellcept 1 , 000 mg p.o. b.i.d. 10. Prempro\n0.625 mg p.o. q. day.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Cigarettes one-half pack per day x31 years.\nAlcohol none. The patient is on disability.\nFAMILY HISTORY: The patient's mother passed away with diabetes\nmellitus.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 98.8 , pulse 96 ,\nblood pressure 120/70 , and\nrespirations 18. GENERAL: In no apparent distress. HEENT:\nPupils equal , round , and reactive to light. Extraocular movements\nwere intact. Cranial nerves II-XII normal with bilateral carotid\nbruits , right more than left. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation\nbilaterally. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm with S1 and S2. No\nmurmurs appreciated. ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , and\nnon-distended. Bowel sounds positive. EXTREMITIES: Without edema\nand warm.\nLABORATORY DATA: The patient had a sodium of 137 , potassium 4.4 ,\nchloride 104 , bicarbonate 15 , BUN 86 , creatinine\n3.1. Creatinine on November , 1999 was 2.7 and creatinine on\nMarch , 1999 was 3.0. ALT was 6 , AST 11 , alkaline phosphatase\n44 , bilirubin total 0.4 , direct bilirubin 0.1 , calcium 9.5 ,\ncholesterol 360 , and HDL 40. White blood cell count was 7.08 ,\nhematocrit 25.9; on November , 1999 , the patient's hematocrit was\n31.9 , and platelets 279. Echocardiogram from July of 1999 had\nmoderate to severe left ventricular hypertrophy , ejection fraction\nof 55% , borderline hypokinetic inferior left ventricular wall , mild\nmitral regurgitation , and left atrial dilatation. Carotid\nnoninvasives from March of 1999 showed no significant right or\nleft internal carotid stenosis.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 50 year old woman with a history of\nend stage renal disease , status post renal\ntransplant in February of 1997 , history of insulin dependent diabetes\nmellitus , coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery\nbypass grafting in 1996 ( left internal mammary artery to left\nanterior descending and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal ) ,\nnow with episodes of rapid heart rate and episodes of skipped beats\nin association without shortness of breath. Also , the patient has\nhad a hematocrit drop from 31 to 26 on admission and a history of\nblood in stool over the last month. The patient was guaiaced on\nadmission and during her stay and remained guaiac negative\nthroughout the whole time. The patient was placed on cardiac\nmonitoring and had no events recorded on the monitor. On July , 2000 , the patient's hematocrit dropped to 21. She was\ntransfused two units of blood and her hematocrit went up to 31. An\nexercise tolerance test MIBI was performed which was negative for\nischemia. The patient's ejection fraction from the MIBI was\napproximated to be 69%. On November , 2000 , carotid\nnon-invasives were repeated which revealed moderate internal\ncarotid plaque on the right. Otherwise , she had mild stenosis of\nthe other arteries. An echocardiogram was also performed which\nrevealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection\nfraction of 65%. The patient was taken to Electrophysiology Study\non March , 2000 which revealed nonsustained ventricular\ntachycardia with possible right ventricular outflow tract origin.\nIt was hoped that she could be maintained on Lopressor and\nVerapamil. Due to the results of this study , the patient was\nalready on Atenolol for Beta blockade and Verapamil was tried.\nHowever , her blood pressure did not tolerate this medication. The\nday after the electrophysiology procedure on January , 2000 , the\npatient was orthostatic. She was given a 250 cc fluid bolus and\nencouraged to drink more p.o. fluids and she was discharged in\nstable condition the next day. The patient remained symptom free\nduring the entire hospital course. The patient's triglycerides\nwere checked during the hospitalization and found to be very high\nin the 1 , 500 range. The patient was therefore taken off\nSimvastatin and started on Gemfibrozil.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day. 2. Vitamin\nC 100 mg p.o. q. day x14 days. 3. Epogen\n2 , 000 subcu q. week. 4. Lasix 60 mg p.o. q. day. 5. Gemfibrozil\n300 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day. 7. Prilosec\n20 mg p.o. q. day. 8. Prednisone 5 mg p.o. on even days , 10 mg\np.o. on odd days. 9. MVI with minerals one tablet p.o. q. day.\n10. Thiamine 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. 11. Bicitra 15 ml p.o. b.i.d.\n12.
