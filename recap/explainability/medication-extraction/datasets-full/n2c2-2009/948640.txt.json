PCP asked patient to come to ED where he was found to\nhave FS of 700 with hypotension 70s-80s SBP but mentating. No gap and\nno ketones. No signs or sx of infection with admission for medical\nmanagement.\nVS: 99.5 101/62 70s SaO2 96% on room air\nEXAM:\nGEN: elderly ill appearing male in NAD\nHEENT: Anicteric sclera , PERRL , dry mucous membranes , poor dentition\nNECK: Supple , no adenopathy , JVP flat\nCHEST: CTA bilaterally\nCV: RRR with diffuse PMI , Nl S1 , S2 S3 present\nABD: Reducible ventral hernia , NT , ND , bowel sounds present\nEXT: No edema or wounds\nSKIN: No rashes\nEKG: paced\nCXR: clear with NAD\nABD CT: small ventral hernia , gallstones , ectasia of the infrarenal\naorta , RLL inflammatory changes suggestive of PNA\nVQ: Low probability\nLABS: Creatinine of 2.2 that dropped to 1.5 with hydration ( BL\n1.2-1.3 ). HCT 41.6 with drop after aggresive hydration. Lipase of 132\nbut has chronic pancreatitis and is now normalizing. UA and ACE\nnegative.\nASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN: 66 YO male with complicated PMH admitted with\nhyperglycemia likely due to non-compliance and hypotension likely due\nto hypovolemia. In ED the patient received 5 liters of IVF and 36U of\ninsulin. His blood pressure stabilized with volume and he was\ntransfered to the medical floor.\nENDOCRINE - DMII but with history of pancreatitis so behaves more like\ntype 1 - needs insulin all the time. Per patient he had been taking 20\nunits of Lantus QAM but patient admitted to poor compliance with both\ndiet and insulin. His A1C was checked and returned at 19. The patient\nwas started on Lantus and Lispro and maintained on an ADA diet. He was\ntitrated to 20 units of Lantus QHS and was requring Lispro for FS\nranging from 120-600. By 10/21 his FS remained better controlled but\nwere still high ranging from 200 to 400 on Lantus 16. On 3/23 the\npatient expressed that he would like to leave. He is discharged o\nn Lantus 20 and Lispro SS with VNA to follow finger sticks. He\nwas maintained on an ADA diet , however , there was some concern he\nmay have been eating sweets on his own. Nutrition was consulted\nand provided teaching regaring diet and diabetes. The patient is\ndischarged to home on Lantus and lispro with VNA following\nHEME - on coumadin for hx of pacer clot. Echo shows pacer clot but\nnot clear whether patient will be compliant enough to go home on\ncoumadin as he has not been in the past. After discussion with\npatient agreement is that we will d/c on coumadin 5 QD ( INR on\nday of d/c 1.2 ) with enough supply for one week. He will have\nblood drawn by VNA with results sent to Dr. Zarkin If he his not\ncompliant with his lab work the coumadin will be stopped.\nCV -\nISCHEMIA: Nonobstuctive CAD on cath in July with no evidence\nof acute episode. Maintained on ASA , ACEi , and Statin. No BB as\ncurrent cocaine user and considered to dangerous\nPUMP: EF: 20-25% Hypovolemic at admission with good response to\nhydration. No episodes of volume overload. On ACEi for AL reduction.\nRHYTHM: CHB with PPM in place\nGI: elevated lipase with chronic pancreatitis with no symptoms and\nresolution after hydration.\nDISPO: The patient is discharged to home in fair condition. He has been\ngiven teaching regarding nutrition , diabetes , and coumadin. His\nmedications has been discussed with him. He agrees to be compliant with\nall medications , to work with VNA , and to attend all of his\nappointments and blood draws. He is discharged home on coumadin and\nLantus to be followed by VNA. He is to follow up with Dr. Harnage within\nthe next week and will be contacted with an appointment\nCODE: DNR/DNI\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. ) Please take your insulin shot ( 20 units of Lantus ) every night at\n10 PM.
