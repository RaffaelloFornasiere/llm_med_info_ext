She reports two months of dyspnea at night ,\nparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea. Over the past two\nweeks prior to admission , the episodes have been becoming worse.\nOn the day of admission , she had an episode of severe substernal\nchest pressure associated with shortness of breath after carrying\nwater bottles from her car. She presented to the Emergency Room\nfor evaluation. In the Emergency Department , V/Q scan was very low\nprobability. She had lower extremity noninvasive studies which\nwere also unremarkable.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Fibromyalgia , hypertension , mild asthma ,\nosteoarthritis of the knee , migraines , total\nabdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , chronic\nfatigue syndrome , deep venous thrombosis in the right lower\nextremity , history of gallstones. Medications on admission\nincluded Nortriptyline , methyldopa , hydrochlorothiazide , Zantac ,\nestrogen , Advil , ALternaGEL.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She works as a supervisor to home health aides.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Notable for coronary artery disease.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient smokes one and one-half packs per\nday for 30 years.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 97.4 , respiratory rate 22 ,\nheart rate 100 , blood pressure 150/90.\nHEENT: Anicteric. LUNGS: In the Emergency Room were notable for\nbibasilar crackles about one-quarter of the way up.\nCARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. II/VI systolic murmur.\nNo rubs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Benign. RECTAL: Guaiac negative in\nthe Emergency Department. EXTREMITIES: 1+ pedal edema\nbilaterally , right greater than left. NEUROLOGICAL: Nonfocal.\nLABORATORY DATA: On admission , hematocrit 41.6 , BUN 13 , creatinine\n0.6. Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema.\nElectrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 91 , no ischemic\nchanges.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for rule out\nmyocardial infarction. She had serial CPKs which\nwere all negative. At that point , her monitor was then\ndiscontinued. The patient's pulmonary edema was treated with two\ndoses of intravenous Lasix ( 20 milligrams each ). This resulted in\na moderate diuresis and resolution of her shortness of breath\nsymptoms. She then underwent an exercise test. This was done with\narm ergometry ( 30 watts ). She went ten minutes , stopped secondary\nto arm fatigue. Her heart rate went from 100 to 129 , blood\npressure went from 130 systolic to 172. Electrocardiogram showed\nno ischemic changes. She had no chest pain or chest pressure with\nthis and this was deemed a negative test. She then underwent an\nechocardiogram which showed vigorous systolic function of 86% , no\nvalvular lesions , no wall motion abnormalities. There was evidence\nof thickening in her ventricular walls.\nGiven the fact that the patient had an elevated diastolic pressure\nand did show some early evidence of thickening in her ventricular\nwalls , the decision was then made to begin her on a calcium channel\nblocker. Verapamil 240 milligrams p.o. q.d. was initiated and the\npatient tolerated this prior to discharge. This was added in\naddition to all her usual medications. She was discharged to home\nin good condition.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Verapamil SR 240 milligrams p.o. q.d.;\nZantac 300 milligrams q.d.; estrogen 1.25\nmilligrams q.d.; Advil 800 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.;\nhydrochlorothiazide 25 milligrams p.o. q.d.; methyldopa 250\nmilligrams q.d.; Nortriptyline 125 milligrams p.o. q.h.s.\nThe patient has scheduled an appointment to see a new primary\nphysician , Dr. Kenneth Finneran at Dowsna Medical Center .  She\nstates that appointment is scheduled for May , 1996.\nDictated By: HOUSTON N. MONSALVE , M.D. HE93\nAttending: ARCHIE J.
