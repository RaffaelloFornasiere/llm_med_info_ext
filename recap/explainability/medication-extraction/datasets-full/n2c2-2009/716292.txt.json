In 1975 , he suffered a myocardial infarction and subse-\nquently had exertional angina. In 8 of November he suffered a second MI\nand underwent three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 21 of April\nAt that time his ejection fraction was 21%. Over the ensuing\nmonths , the patient noted markedly worsening symptoms of CHF with\northopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and dyspnea on exertion.\nOne week prior to transfer , the patient was admitted to Ment Hospital for management of his congestive heart failure. He was\ninitially treated with afterload reduction , digoxin and Lasix.\nOn this regimen , a PA line was placed with the following read-\nings: RA 8 , RV 76/4 , TA 80/36 , pulmonary capillary wedge pres-\nsure 34 , and cardiac index 1.49. Echocardiogram revealed dilated\nleft ventricle with global hypokinesis , tricuspid regurgitation ,\nand PA systolic pressure 80mmHg. The patient was treated with\ndobutamine , intravenous TNG , and nitroprusside with symptomatic\nrelief and hemodynamic stabilization with wedge pressure falling\nto 18. TNG and Nipride were successfully weaned. However , the\npatient remained dobutamine dependent.\nThe patient was transferred to the Edpointe Soupied Cantjean Hospital for evalu-\nation for transplantation. At the time of admission he noted\ndyspnea on minimal exertion but not at rest. He denied chest\npain , palpitations , lightheadedness , or syncope. The patient is\nmarried , and worked as a janitor until March of 1991. He is\nmarried with seven children and lives in S .\nThe patient's PAST MEDICAL HISTORY is significant for severe\nabdominal trauma many years ago , having been gored by a bull.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Discharge physical examination is nota-\nble for a blood pressure of 100/50 , a\nheart rate of between 100 and 110 , a respiratory rate of 18 , a\nblood pressure of 112/66 , a temperature of 97.1 , and a weight of\n80.4 kilograms. The patient is in normal sinus rhythm with occa-\nsional short bursts of ventricular tachycardia last two days\nprior to discharge. LUNGS: Occasional crackles. HEART: Sounds\ndistant. ABDOMEN: Benign. EXTREMITIES: Trace edema.\nLABORATORY DATA: Discharge sodium 134 , potassium 4.2 , BUN\n32 , creatinine 1.4. White count 9.8 ,\nhematocrit 29.2 , platelets 253. ALT 14 , AST 8 , LDH 223 , total\nbilirubin 0.6 , direct bilirubin 0.3 , albumin 2.8 , total protein\n5.9 , cholesterol 106.\nMEDICATIONS at time of discharge include dobutamine at 15 mcg per\nkilogram per minute; captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; digoxin 0.125\nmg p.o. q.d.; Lasix 160 mg p.o. b.i.d.; potassium chloride 20 mEq\np.o. b.i.d.; Coumadin 1 mg p.o. q.d.; Atrovent , two puffs q.i.d.;\nAzmacort , eight puffs b.i.d.; Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Colace\n100 mg p.o. t.i.d.; vancomycin 1 gm q. 12 , discontinued 9-23 a.m.\nafter 14 days; ampicillin 2 gm IV q. 6 ( 24 of June equals day number\nfive ); Halcion 0.125 p.o. q.h.s. prn; Serax 15 mg p.o. q. 6 hours\nprn.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Transplant Listing: The patient has\nbeen listed for cardiac transplant ,\nhas had all the necessary preoperative workup including pulmonary\nfunction tests and tissue typing. Should a heart become avail-\nable , he could be Medivacked back to the Peters Of for surgery.\nThe patient's hospital course was significant for the following\nworkup: He had a catheterization 15 of October , which showed patent\ngrafts and occluded native left anterior descending and obtuse\nmarginal branch. An echocardiogram on 28 of June showed mitral regurg-\nitation , an ejection fraction of less than 20% , and no vegeta-\ntions on the valve.\nThe patient's most significant problem during his hospital course\nincluded temperatures. On 1 of May , he had an increased temperature\nto 101 and increased white count with left shift. His central\nline was pulled , and the tip grew gram positive cocci. The\npatient also grew gram positive cocci from two blood cultures.\nHe was started on vancomycin and defervesced , and has been\nafebrile for four days.\nSubsequently , the patient again became febrile approximately one\nweek into his vancomycin course. At this point he was recul-\ntured , and those cultures grew gram negative rods in one out of\nfour blood culture specimens. These were gram negative enteric\nrods , pan-sensitive , for which the patient was started on\nampicillin 2 gm IV q. 6. This was felt most likely secondary to\na urinary tract infection from the Foley catheter , which has been\ndiscontinued.\nAt the time of discharge , the patient is stable , dobutamine\ndependent , without chest pain , able to ambulate from chair to\ncommode without shortness of breath , palpitations , or light-\nheadedness. He is eager to be transferred back to the Ston area to await heart transplant.\nWith any questions , please contact Doctor Wilmer Priore Tucap Anathens Sol Health Services 265-8948 , beeper number 7217 , the patient's\nmedical intern.\nThe patient's condition at time of discharge is fair.\nDISPOSITION: Continuing care in the coronary care\nunit of the hospital inpatient near\npatient's home. The patient will be under the care of a Doctor\nDaren Swasey\nDictated By: JESS HESSER , M.D. MI73\nAM887/4014\nMCKINLEY STACEY DILLOW , M.D. JR4 D: 3/22/91\nT: 3/22/91\nBatch: O270 Report: KH817R19 T:\n[report_end]\n", "annotations": [{"medication_name": "lasix", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "15"}, {"medication_name": "digoxin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "15"}, {"medication_name": "this regimen", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "16"}, {"medication_name": "tng", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "intravenous", "frequency": "", "line": "21"}, {"medication_name": "dobutamine", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "21"}, {"medication_name": "nitroprusside", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "21"}, {"medication_name": "nipride", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "23"}, {"medication_name": "tng", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "23"}, {"medication_name": "dobutamine", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "24"}, {"medication_name": "dobutamine", "medication_dosage": "15 mcg per kilogram", "mode": "", "frequency": "per minute;", "line": "46"}, {"medication_name": "digoxin", "medication_dosage": "0.125 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.d.", "line": "47"}, {"medication_name": "captopril", "medication_dosage": "25 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "t.i.d.", "line": "47"}, {"medication_name": "potassium chloride", "medication_dosage": "20 meq", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "b.i.d.", "line": "48"}, {"medication_name": "lasix", "medication_dosage": "160 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "b.i.d.", "line": "48"}, {"medication_name": "coumadin", "medication_dosage": "1 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.d.", "line": "49"}, {"medication_name": "atrovent", "medication_dosage": "two puffs", "mode": "", "frequency": "q.i.d.", "line": "49"}, {"medication_name": "colace", "medication_dosage": "100 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "t.i.d.", "line": "50"}, {"medication_name": "azmacort", "medication_dosage": "eight puffs", "mode": "", "frequency": "b.i.d.", "line": "50"}, {"medication_name": "pepcid", "medication_dosage": "20 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "b.i.d.", "line": "50"}, {"medication_name": "vancomycin", "medication_dosage": "1 gm", "mode": "", "frequency": "q. 12", "line": "51"}, {"medication_name": "ampicillin", "medication_dosage": "2 gm", "mode": "iv", "frequency": "q. 6", "line": "52"}, {"medication_name": "halcion", "medication_dosage": "0.125", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.h.s. prn", "line": "53"}, {"medication_name": "serax", "medication_dosage": "15 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q. 6 hours prn", "line": "53"}, {"medication_name": "vancomycin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "71"}, {"medication_name": "vancomycin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "74"}, {"medication_name": "ampicillin", "medication_dosage": "2 gm", "mode": "iv", "frequency": "q. 6.", "line": "78"}, {"medication_name": "dobutamine", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "81"}]}
