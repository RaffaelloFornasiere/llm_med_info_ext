Also diabetes mellitus type\nII complicated by retinopathy , nephropathy and question neuropathy.\nHistory of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia as well who\npresented to Dr. Bouie clinic on March , 2001 with\nprogressive increasing dyspnea , increasing abdominal girth and\nweight gain over the past few months.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes mellitus x 20 years , chronic renal\ninsufficiency with the last creatinine in\nMarch of 3.5 , congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of\n30% in March of 2000 , coronary artery disease status post\nmyocardial infarction , March 2000 question f silent myocardial\ninfarction x 2 , history of hyperlipidemia.\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin daily , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day ,\nZaroxolyn 2.5 mg p.o. q day , toprol XL\n50 mg p.o. q day , insulin 70/30 65/45 , Actos 45 q p.m , Avapro 300\nmg p.o. q day , Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , sublingual nitroglycerin\np.r.n..\nPHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98.1 , blood pressure 116/70 , pulse 88 ,\nprimary care physician of 18. The patient appeared\nto be in no acute distress. Jugular venous pressure approximately\n13 cm water. LUNGS: Faint bibasilar rales. CARDIAC:\nTachycardia , regular rhythm without murmurs. ABDOMEN: Positive ,\nnormal active bowel sounds. Obese , distended and nontender.\nEXTREMITIES: 2 plus dorsalis pedis pulse , 2-3 plus edema\nbilaterally to the knees.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: It was felt that given notes\nof thyroid dysfunction , his history was\nconsistent with fluid overload. His jugular venous pressure was\nelevated and he had 3plus pitting edema to the knees without\nsignificant rales on chest exam. He was aggressively diuresed with\ndoses of Lasix 200 mg b.i.d. IV as well as Zaroxolyn. Weight on\nadmission was 135 kilograms and on discharge he was down to 132\nkilograms. A repeat echocardiogram at Ethool Hospital\nshowed an ejection fraction of 30-35 , left ventricular dimensions\nof 47 mm , 1 plus mitral regurgitation and global hypokinesis as\nwell as moderate right ventricular dysfunction. Abdominal\nultrasound showed no ascites despite extremely distended abdomen\nand right renal cyst x 2. Follow up abdominal CT also showed there\nwas no mass or ascites and his distended abdomen was likely due to\nadipose tissue. Diuresis was limited by acute and chronic renal\nfailure and oliguria. Diuresis was held from March , 2001.\nRight heart catheterization on February , 2001 showed mildly\nelevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and moderately elevated\nright ventricular pressures. Dopamine was started on November ,\n2001 to aid with renal perfusion and diuresis and he was then\nweaned off of that on August , 2001. His Lasix was stopped on\nAugust , 2001 and he auto-diuresed until the time of discharge\nwith stable blood pressure. He remained stable with no dyspnea at\nrest and is symptom free at the time of discharge.\n2. Renal: His basic chronic renal insufficiency is likely\nsecondary to poor diabetic control with a creatinine of 2.5 on March , 2001 , 3.3 at the time of admission. Acute renal failure with\nincreasing creatinine of 6 after aggressive diuresis with a mean of\n0.8 percent. Renal function improved with creatinine of 4.1 on\nAugust , 2001 with autodiuresis. The renal service was\nconsulted to comment on the nature of the patient's renal\ninsufficiency and acute renal failure as well as to assist in the\nuse of vasodilators.\n3. Endocrine: He has a long standing history of type II diabetes\ncomplicated by retinopathy and neuropathy and nephropathy. He was\nmaintained on his outpatient endocrine regimen during his stay.\nThe patient was discharged home with services. He is to follow up\nwith Dr. Marro on June , 2001 at 3:30 p.m. , with Dr. Loatman on\nNovember , 2002 at 3:30 p.m. , Dr. Carcano March , 2001 at 10:00\na.m.\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q day , Lasix 80 mg\np.o. q day , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,\ninsulin 70/30 65 units q a.m. , insulin 70/30 45 units q p.m. ,\nToprol XL 50 mg p.o. q day , Levaquin 250 mg p.o. q day for a\nduration of 7 days , Actos 45 mg p.o. q p.m.\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.\nDictated By: BENJAMIN DOUYON , M.D. RB65\nAttending: RUDOLF D.
