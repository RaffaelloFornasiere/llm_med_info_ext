ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Trudell is a 69 year old woman\nwith a history of coronary artery\ndisease , status post an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in\nMarch 1996. She had a cardiac catheterization at the time , which\nshowed an 80% mid left anterior descending artery lesion , and 80%\nleft circumflex lesion before OM1 , 50% proximal right coronary\nartery lesion , and an 80% posterior left ventricular branch lesion.\nShe was also noted to have inferior and anterolateral HK with an\nejection fraction of 52%. The patient expressed her desire to be\nmanaged conservatively , and was medically managed for the following\nyear. She had a sub-max exercise tolerance test prior to discharge\nand one month later had a full BRUCE protocol going six minutes\nwith less than 1 mm ST segment depressions in several leads. The\npatient did well for the past year without symptoms until 1:00 a.m.\non the morning of admission when she woke from sleep with\nsubsternal chest pain. She took sublingual nitroglycerin with\nrelief after half and hour but at 3:00 a.m. the pain recurred with\nnausea. The patient took two sublingual nitroglycerin with\nresolution of the pain by 4:00 a.m. She presented to the emergency\ndepartment free of pain and electrocardiogram at the time showed\nchanges consistent with anterior ischemia. The patient was\nadmitted with unstable angina for evaluation.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for coronary artery disease ,\nhypertension , status post cholecystectomy.\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include simvastatin 10 mg q.h.s. ,\nsublingual nitroglycerin , enalapril\n5 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg q.d. , Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.\nALLERGIES: She had no known drug allergies.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pulse of 62 , regular and blood\npressure 160/80 , respiratory rate 12 , oxygen\nsaturation of 99% on three liters nasal cannula. There was no\nevidence of jugular venous distention , carotids 2+ bilaterally , no\nbruits. Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart\nexamination revealed a regular rate and rhythm and an S4 was\npresent. Abdomen was obese , soft , nontender and nondistended with\nnormal bowel sounds present. Extremities were without edema.\nLABORATORY DATA: On admission the patient's initial CK was 111.\nHer second CK was 452 , with an MB fraction of\n45.1 , third CK was 550 with an MB fraction of 47.9 , and a fourth CK\nof 439 with MB fraction of 33.5 , fifth CK of 261 , with MB fraction\nof 14.9 , and a sixth CK of 156. SMA seven was normal.\nTroponin I was 0.0 on admission. White blood count of 11 ,\nhematocrit 39.7. Chest x-ray was unremarkable for any infiltrate\nor any congestive heart failure evidence. Electrocardiogram\nrevealed normal sinus rhythm at 75 , axis 0 , 2 to 3 ST segment\nelevation in V1 through V3 , 1 mm elevation in V4 , less than 1 mm ST\nsegment depressions in 1 , AVL , and V5 , V6. These changes were new\ncompared to a previous electrocardiogram from March 1996.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to CCU , at which time\nshe was pain free and her electrocardiogram\nabnormalities had resolved. Her heart rate and blood pressure were\ncontrolled with intravenous medications and she was managed\nmedically until hospital day three when she was taken of the\ncardiac catheterization laboratory. Cardiac catheterization\nrevealed a 90% plus left anterior descending artery lesion distal\nto D1 with evidence of thrombus , 60% proximal left circumflex\nlesion with diffuse disease in the OM1 , a 40% right coronary artery\nlesion , left ventriculogram revealed anterior lateral apical and\nseptal HK and AK. The patient returned to the cardiac\ncatheterization laboratory the following day for PTCA and stenting\nof her left anterior descending artery lesion followed by ReoPro\ninfusion. From the time of her admission to the Cardiac Care Unit\nthroughout her hospital stay the patient did not have recurrence of\nher chest pain. Cardiac enzymes returned to baseline.\nElectrocardiogram revealed ST segments also returned to baseline.\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Include aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,\nsimvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Ticlid 250\nmg p.o. b.i.d. for 11 days , Atenolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , enalapril\n20 mg p.o. q.d. The patient is instructed to resume a low fat , low\ncholesterol diet. Activity as tolerated.\nFOLLOW-UP: With Dr. Kroell on 10/10/97 at 3:50 p.m. and will\nalso follow-up with Dr. Brendlinger in the end of November or\nbeginning of May , to be arranged.\nDictated By: ABE HENSLER , M.D. MM88\nAttending: RUSTY D.
