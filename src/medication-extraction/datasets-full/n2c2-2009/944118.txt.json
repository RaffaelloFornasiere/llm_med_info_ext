He will followup with Dr. Clesen on Monday. He will be evaluated\nthis week with TTE with bubble-study to r/o intracardiac source or PFO.\nWould also consider EEG if Neurology deems possibility of seizure. In the\nmeantime , added low-dose glyburide to metformin to manage hyperglycemia\nat home , with more strips to monitor blood sugars 3-4x / day. Have also\nincreased aspirin dose from 81 mg to 325 mg qd.

Continue to check your\nblood sugars 3-4 times per day. You can also obtain an automatic BP cuff\nfor monitoring at home. If episode recurs , do not drive , check\nsugars and BP , drink fluids , contact MD or return to ED as soon as\npossible.\nDISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable\nTO DO/PLAN:\nf/u with Dr. Wantuck on February , that week should have TTE with bubble\nstudy to evaluate heart , EEG to r/o seizure , titer hyperglycemia meds\nNo dictated summary\nENTERED BY: RIEGLE , TRISTAN F. , M.D. ( SN83 ) 10/5/06 @ 01:46 PM\n****** END OF DISCHARGE ORDERS ******\n[report_end]\n", "annotations": [{"medication_name": "acetylsalicylic acid", "medication_dosage": "81 mg", "mode": "po", "frequency": "daily", "line": "19"}, {"medication_name": "lipitor ( atorvastatin )", "medication_dosage": "10 mg", "mode": "po", "frequency": "daily", "line": "21"}, {"medication_name": "glyburide", "medication_dosage": "2.5 mg", "mode": "po", "frequency": "daily", "line": "22"}, {"medication_name": "metformin", "medication_dosage": "500 mg", "mode": "po", "frequency": "bid", "line": "23"}, {"medication_name": "metformin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "48"}, {"medication_name": "acyclovir", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "54"}, {"medication_name": "insulin", "medication_dosage": "sliding scale", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "64"}, {"medication_name": "metformin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "76"}, {"medication_name": "glyburide", "medication_dosage": "low-dose", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "76"}, {"medication_name": "aspirin", "medication_dosage": "81 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "qd.", "line": "78"}, {"medication_name": "aspirin", "medication_dosage": "325 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "qd.", "line": "78"}, {"medication_name": "glyburide", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "once a day", "line": "80"}, {"medication_name": "metformin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "twice a day.", "line": "81"}]}
