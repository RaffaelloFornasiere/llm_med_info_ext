ANEMIA.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Christin is an 80 year old female who\npresents to an outside hospital with\nchest pain. She states the night prior to admission she felt some\nshortness of breath and tightness in her chest upon laying down.\nShe took one sublingual Nitroglycerin without relief.

She\nwas there treated with intravenous Lasix , morphine and\nNitroglycerin with resolution of her pain. EKG at outside hospital\nshowed anterolateral ST depression and her enzymes were negative\nruling out for myocardial infarction. She has cardiac risk factors\nof hypertension , hypercholesterolemia and age. Her cardiac\nsymptomatology began in the fall of 1999 when she began to\nexperience chest discomfort with exertion and rest. Evaluation by\nDr. Jose Esparza showed high cholesterol with an LDL 141 , EKG with LVH\nand nonspecific T wave flattening. A Thallium stress test in\nNovember of 1999 was three minutes , fifty-two seconds duration ,\nstopped secondary to shortness of breath , and there were\ninferolateral ST depressions with inferior apical ischemia on\nimaging. She had her symptoms managed medically with cholesterol\nlowering and antihypertensive therapy.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension ,\nhypercholesterolemia , angina , Paget's\ndisease , anemia , osteoarthritis.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She is widowed , she lives alone.

White blood cell count of\n8 , 000 , hematocrit 26.9 , platelet count 238. Urinalysis was\nnegative. EKG on admission showed normal sinus rhythm at 60 beats\nper minute with ST segment depression V4 through V6 approximately 1\nmm and approximately 1 mm ST depression in lead II.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Dison was admitted to Ster Hospital for evaluation of her angina after\nruling out at an outside hospital , however , on presentation her\nlaboratory values were consistent with a myocardial infarction and\nher hospital course is summarized as follows.\n1. CARDIOVASCULAR: Ms. Berish ruled in for a myocardial infarction\nwith a peak CK of 459 with an MB of 28.7. This decreased to 328\nwith an MB of 15.4 the following morning. Her troponin was 15.\nShe , however , remained asymptomatic and pain free throughout her\nhospitalization. She underwent cardiac catheterization on May , 2000 which showed an okay left main , LAD with proximal 90%\nstenosis , which underwent PTCA and stenting with good result , an\nosteal D-1 80% lesion which underwent PTCA with good result , a\ntotally occluded proximal left circumflex and a right coronary with\na proximal 30% to 40% stenosis. She tolerated this procedure well\nand without complications. Her medical regimen was altered to\ninclude beta blockade , ACE inhibition and antihypertensives and\nischemics , as outlined below. Of note , left ventriculogram on her\ncatheterization showed anterior hypokinesis with 3+ mitral\nregurgitation.\n2. ANEMIA: Ms. Flewellen has a known normochromic , normocytic anemia\nwhich was worked up during this hospitalization. She had a\nhematocrit of 26.9 on admission for which she was transfused one\nunit of packed red blood cells.
