Cath showed impaired flow in the inferior\nand posterolateral zones due to obstructive degenerative disease in\nthe SVGs to the RCA and LCF-OM. Stent placed in the RCA graft though\nthere was extensive calcification and difficulty\nobtaining full stent expansion , and following the stent deployment\nthere was poor reflow accompanied by mild chest pain and EKG changes ,\nwithout hemodynamic embarrassment. Pt was transferred back\nto the CCU stable and without pain. Pt was scheduled for call out to\nfloor , but had an episode of jaw sensation , different from previous\nangina. Pt was upset by turn of events , but was calmed by staff.
