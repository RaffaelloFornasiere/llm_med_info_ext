The patient presented with substernal\nchest pain to the emergency room department with a blood pressure\nof 230/90. The patient's blood pressure was controlled with IV\nLopressor and the patient was admitted for rule out myocardial\ninfarction. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on\n2/25/99 which revealed the following: A stent restenosis of left\ncircumflex artery , a 60 percent left anterior descending artery\nstenosis , a 70 percent diagonal ostial stenosis , a 40 percent\nostial right coronary artery stenosis , and 95 percent ostial\nposterior descending artery stenosis. No myocardial infarction was\nnoted and ejection fraction was approximately 50 percent\ncalculated. The patient was subsequently scheduled for coronary\nartery bypass graft.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease. Hypertension.\nCongestive heart failure. Type II diabetes\nmellitus requiring insulin. Peripheral vascular disease.\nGastroesophageal reflux disease.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Left lower extremity revascularization.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Spanish-speaking female. HEENT:\nUnremarkable. Carotid pulses 1 plus\nbilaterally with no bruits. Lungs clear to auscultation\nbilaterally. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.\nAbdomen: Soft , nontender , nondistended. Firm to palpation in both\nlower quadrants in area of lower midline scar. Extremities:\nTenderness to palpation in bilateral lower extremities which was\ndiffuse and nonspecific. Peripheral pulses revealed 1 plus\ndorsalis pedis pulse and 1 plus posterior tibial pulse on right\nlower extremity and 2 plus dorsalis pedis pulse and 2 plus\nposterior tibial pulse on left lower extremity with 1 plus edema\nbilaterally. Neurologic: The patient was conscious and alert and\noriented times three with no deficits.\nLABORATORY DATA: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.7 , BUN 18 , creatinine\n1.0 , glucose 205. WBC 12 , hematocrit 37 , INR\n0.1. ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave\nchanges.\nMEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg q.d. , Atenolol 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,\nCaptopril 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Colace , Axid 150 mg\np.o. b.i.d. , Amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Imdur 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,\nand insulin NPH 22 units q.a.m. and regular 10 units q.a.m.\nALLERGIES: Penicillin- rash.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: On 1/30/99 the patient was brought to the\noperating room and underwent a coronary artery\nbypass graft times three with a left internal mammary artery to the\nleft anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse\nmarginal and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.\nAfter surgery the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care\nUnit in stable condition. On postoperative day #1 the patient was\nextubated without incident.\nOn postoperative day #2 the patient experienced a period of atrial\nfibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and rates in the\n150s. The patient was treated with IV Lopressor and Diltiazem drip\nat 10 mg/hr. The patient subsequently converted spontaneously to\nnormal sinus rhythm. Postoperatively the patient continued to\nexperience hypertension with systolic blood pressures ranging from\n160s to 190s. The patient was started back on Lopressor and\nCaptopril and gradually increased to preoperative doses. The\npatient was also started back on Amlodipine for further blood\npressure control. The patient continued to experience brief\nepisodes of atrial fibrillation with spontaneous conversion to\nnormal sinus rhythm. The patient was followed by her cardiologist\npostoperatively , Dr. Grunow . The patient was started on\nanticoagulation with Coumadin. The patient's atrial fibrillation\ncontinued to decrease in frequency and duration and , at the time of\ndischarge , the patient had been in normal sinus rhythm for greater\nthan 24 hours. The patient was seen by physical therapy service\nand it was felt that the patient would benefit from rehabilitation.\nThe patient is scheduled to be discharged on postoperative day #8\nto rehabilitation facility in stable condition with all wounds\nclean and dry.\nOn day of discharge her sodium is 137 , potassium 3.9 , BUN 16 ,\ncreatinine 0.9 , glucose 163. WBC 16.7 , hematocrit 31 , platelet\ncount 340 , INR 2.3.\nDISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,\nCaptopril 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o.\nt.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , insulin 22 units NPH subcu q.a.m.\nand 10 units regular subcu q.a.m. , CZI regular insulin sliding\nscale , Percocet 1 to 2 tablets p.o. q3 - 4h p.r.n. pain , Zantac 150\nmg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin dosed to INR of 2 to 2.5 , and Amlodipine 5\nmg p.o. q.d. FOLLOWUP: The patient is to follow-up in six weeks\nwith cardiac surgeon , Dr. Standrew , with primary care physician , Dr.\nBirdsong , in one to two weeks , and with cardiologist , Dr. Shelko ,\nin one to two weeks. The patient was discharged to the Faithhugh Lowe County Memorial Hospital . \nDictated By: MARCEL SHABOT , P.A.\nAttending: DOYLE S.
