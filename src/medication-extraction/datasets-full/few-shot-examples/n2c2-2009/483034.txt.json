She underwent high-dose\nchemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue in 10/6 .  Her\ntransplant was complicated by worsening of her baseline impaired\nlung function , and she has been oxygen dependent since the time\nof transplant. In 3/24 , she began to have back pain and\neventually was shown to have recurrent or increasing disease in\nthe retroperitoneum by abdominal CT ( paraaortic at the level of\nL2 ). The decision was made to pursue radiation therapy to this\narea , which she completed on 4/7/05 . The patient presented\nwith complaints of pain in the mid lower back radiating in a\nband-like distribution around the waist to the abdomen as well as\ninto the right hip and buttock area. The pain also radiated into\nthe right thigh with movement for weightbearing. The patient\nreports the pain was occasionally associated with numbness in the\nright lateral thigh. She denied any radiation of the pain to\nbelow the knee. She denied any numbness in the lower legs , back\nor saddle area. She denied any change in bowel or bladder\nfunction.\nThe patient had fluoroscopic LP on 10/19/05 with a glucose of 69 ,\na total protein of 49.3 , and cytology which was negative. Plain\nfilms of her hip showed enthesopathy of the superior pelvis\nbilaterally , lower lumbar spine degeneration , and sclerotic focus\nin the proximal region of the right femur. MRI of the lumbar\nspine on 4/7/05 showed an irregular soft tissue mass within the\nretroperitoneum centered anterior to the spine at the level of\nL2 , position posterior to the IVC and right lateral aorta\nmeasuring 4.5 x 2.7 x 3.4 cm; there is a lesion involving the\nanterior superior aspect to the L2 vertebral body continuous with\nthe anterior paraspinal mass with wedging and probable pathologic\ncompression fracture. No epidural mass.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Recurrent lymphoma.\n2. Pulmonary function thought to be due in part to BCNU\nchemotherapy , currently on 5 liters home O2.\n3. Status post cholecystectomy.\n4. Obesity.\nMEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:\n1. Prednisone 10 mg p.o. daily.\n2. Imuran 100 mg p.o. q.a.m. , 50 mg p.o. q.p.m.\n3. Coumadin 6 mg p.o. q.h.s.\n4. Lasix 60 mg p.o. daily.\n5. Potassium t.i.d.\n6. Folic acid.\n7. Multivitamin.\n8. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n9. MiraLax.\n10. Paxil 10 mg p.o. daily.\n11. MS-Contin 60 mg p.o. t.i.d.\n12. Flexeril one tab p.o. t.i.d.\nALLERGIES:\nSulfa , latex.\nFAMILY HISTORY:\nFather died at the age of 50 from a brain tumor. Mother was\ndiagnosed with uterine cancer , coronary artery disease , and\ndiabetes.\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\nThe patient lives with her husband in Holl Cho Shing She denies tobacco and alcohol. She has four grown\nchildren.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:\nVitals: Temperature 97.6 , heart rate 91 , blood pressure 140/90 ,\nrespiratory rate 22 , oxygen saturation 97% on 5 liters. In\ngeneral , the patient was found to be alert and oriented x3 with\ndifficulty standing secondary to pain and habitus. HEENT:\nPupils were equally round and reactive to light. Normal sclerae ,\nnormal conjunctivae. Extraocular movements were intact. Moist\nmucous membranes and clear oropharynx. Neck: No\nlymphadenopathy , no thyromegaly. Pulmonary: Clear to\nauscultation bilaterally with some wheeze at the right base.\nCardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , no\nmurmurs , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen: Morbid obesity , nontender ,\nnormoactive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly. Back: Mild\nparaspinal tenderness bilaterally. Extremities: Bilateral lower\nextremity edema. Neuro: 2/5 hip flexion and knee extension and\nflexion on the right; 5/5 hip flexion and knee extension and\nflexion on the right; 5/5 hip flexion and knee extension and\nflexion on the left; distal neuropathy.\nLABORATORY STUDIES:\nAt the time of admission , white cell count 9.8 , hematocrit 35.5 ,\nplatelets 249. INR 2.1 , PTT 45.8. BMP showed a sodium of 139 ,\npotassium 4.2 , chloride 99 , bicarbonate 36 , BUN 19 , creatinine\n0.6 , glucose 126. LFTs were within normal limits. UA showed 2+\nbacteria but no white cells.\nIn general , this is a 57-year-old female with follicular lymphoma\nwho presented for workup of lower back pain recurring status post\nXRT to the lumbar spine region.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\n1. Oncology: CT of the thoracic , lumbar , and sacral spine on\n2/10/05 showed no evidence of cord compression but did show a\ncompression fracture at L2. IR was consulted on 11/24/05\nregarding the possibility of kyphoplasty to this area; however ,\nthey deferred further treatment , as the pain was thought to be\nsecondary to hip pathology rather than lumbar spine pathology.\nCT of the right hip on 11/24/05 showed a lytic lesion in the\nposterior acetabulum with an associated fracture. The patient\nwas evaluated by Orthopedic Oncology as well as Radiation\nOncology. Dr. Cestia with Orthopedic Oncology deferred any\nsurgical intervention until the completion of radiation therapy.\nThe patient started radiation therapy to the right hip on\n5/18/05 . The contact in Radiation Oncology is Britt L Redden , M.D. , pager number 93376. The plan is for the\npatient to complete a course of 18 treatments of radiation to the\nright hip. The patient will then have a repeat CT of the right\nhip in one month's time and follow up with Dr. Saralegui . She has an\nappointment to meet with Dr. Strief on 6/13/05 at 2:45 p.m. Per\nrecommendations of Orthopedic Oncology and Physical Therapy , the\npatient is to be touched down weightbearing on the right leg\n( toes only ) and full weightbearing on the left leg. It is\nexpected that she should be able to undergo physical therapy with\nthe use of a walker. She should be kept on posterior hip\nprecaution with limitation of hip flexion and internal rotation\nof the right hip.\n2. Pain: The patient was seen by the Pain Service during this\nhospitalization. Her current pain regimen includes methadone 5\nmg p.o. t.i.d. , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and 100 mg p.o.\nq.8. a.m. and q. noon , MSIR 30 mg p.o. q.h.s. as well as 15-30 mg\nq.2h. as needed. The patient was also started on Decadron 10 mg\np.o. q.a.m. given her initial concern for spinal cord\ncompression. She has been tapering off of the Decadron and will\nbe discharged on 4 mg p.o. q.a.m. with taper as listed in the\ndischarge instructions. Once the patient has completed Decadron\n2 mg p.o. q.a.m. x3 doses , she should then be started on\nprednisone 10 mg p.o. daily per her home dosing for pulmonary\ndisease. The patient did receive pamidronate 90 mg IV x1 during\nthis hospitalization.\n3. ID: UA on admission was more or less benign , and urine\nculture remained negative. The patient was afebrile throughout\nher hospitalization. She was given a five-day course of\nacyclovir 200 mg p.o. five times per day for concern of recurrent\ngenital herpes. Given continued complaints of vaginal itching ,\nthe patient was given fluconazole 150 mg x1 on 9/29/05 to treat\na presumed yeast infection.\n4. GI: The patient has a history of constipation secondary to\nuse of pain medication. She has been having good bowel movement\non MiraLax , Senna , Colace. She has also writing for Dulcolax\np.r.n. for constipation.\n5. Heme: The patient is on Coumadin given a recent history of\nDVT. She had an INR of 3.7 two days prior to admission , so her\ndosing was reduced during this hospitalization. Her INR has been\nstable and is at 2.3 at the time of discharge on dosing of 4.5 mg\np.o. q.h.s.\n6. Pulmonary: As mentioned above , the patient has a pulmonary\ndysfunction with a home O2 requirement of 5 liters. She has been\nstable on this home O2 requirement throughout this\nhospitalization. She does require CPAP at night for obstructive\nsleep apnea.\n7. Cardiovascular: No known history of cardiovascular disease.\nEcho on 11/28/04 showed an EF of 55%.\n8. Endo: The patient is on a sliding scale of regular insulin\nwhile on Decadron. It is intended that this should be stopped\nwhen the Decadron taper has finished.\n9. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: The patient had some\nhypocalcemia during this hospitalization. She was started on\nTums 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. , with good response. She was also given\npamidronate x1 as listed above.\nCODE:\nFull code.\nDISPOSITION:\nThe patient is being discharged to the Ensers 1 for further\nrehabilitation. She has a lytic lesion in the right hip with\nevidence of fracture. Per recommendations of Orthopedic Oncology\nas well as physical therapy , please limit right leg to touchdown\nweightbearing only. The patient should be full weightbearing on\nthe left leg with physical therapy involving use of a walker.\nThe patient was stable at the time of discharge. She should\ncontinue with her radiation therapy to completion and then follow\nup with Dr. Kelvin Lang , in Orthopedic Oncology on 6/13/05 .\nMEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE: Include ,\nImuran 100 mg p.o. q.a.m. , 50 mg p.o. q.p.m.; Dulcolax 5 mg p.o.\ndaily p.r.n. for constipation; calcium carbonate 500 mg p.o.\nt.i.d.; Flexeril 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.; dexamethasone 4 mg p.o. daily\nx2 doses then 2 mg p.o. daily x3 doses then start prednisone 10\nmg p.o. daily.
