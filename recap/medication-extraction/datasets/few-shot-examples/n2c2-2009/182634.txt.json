Pt had PET scan on\n1/29 which showed uptake in asc colon and hep\nflexure concerning for malignancy. CT colonoscopy\nshowed 1.6 les in desc colon and colonoscopy under\nGA performed due to difficulty of going beyond\nhep flexure. Pt had hypoxia to 80s when\nawakening from anesthesia. Temp to 101.1. CXR showed\n?LLL opacity. Thought to be likely Pneumonitis vs. asp PNA. In Pacu\nPt also had EKG changes , TWIs and ? BBB assoc\nwith HR70s-80s. EKGs resolved when rate in 60s.\nPhysical Exam revealed AOOx3 woman in NAD. PERRL. No carotid bruits.\nCardiac exam remarkable for RRR , 2/6 murmur at RUSB. There are\ncrackles at LL base to mid lung field. Abd exam there is\nrebound and invol guarding. Tenderness in epigastric\nand suprapubic area. +BS. No hepatomegaly.\nLabs significant for HCt 24 from baseline of 30 , Cr\n1.9 from baseline of 1.6. Cardiac enzymes were flat.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:****************\n1. Pulm-On floor pt's oxygenation improved within one day to 96% on RA\nLikely aspiration , but final read on\nCXR shows no infiltrate/opacity. Levo/Flagyl given empirically x 5days\nthough she remained afeb.\n2. CV-Pt has h/o MI , RCA stent , mod AS. Low Hct and EKG changes\nconcerning for\nmyocardial injury. Her cardiac enzymes were negative after the initial\nhypoxic episode , and EKG changes resolved. Transfused 2u PRBCs. On\n1/16 she had Afib with RVR to 130s with chest arm pain which is her\nanginal equivalent. ECG with rate related ischemia ST depression\nV5-6 , L. +Minimal troponin leak to 0.19 , which subseq downtrended\nwith nl CK. She was init treated with lopressor 5mg\nIV but had hypotension to 80's which resolved quickly with IVF. She was\neventually rate controlled with dilt drip. She returned to sinus\nrhythm within the day. Cards c/s'd\nand recommended amio load. She had PFT's , LFT's and TFT's prior to\nd/c. Plan to follow up with Dr. Lenberg . Consider anticoagulation for\nPAF , this is at least 2nd episode. Pt to restart ecasa 5d p colonosco\npy.\n2. GI-Pt had abd exam concerning for focal peritoneal\nirritation. It is likely that she had a microperforation during\ncolonoscopy as CT showed fluid in pelvis and she had Hct drop\nrequiring 2U pRBC. Her exam improved , and she was tolerating PO well\nat the time of discharge. She has been afeb and well appearing for\nseveral days prior to d/c. Plan to complete 5d abx. As per Dr. Thorburn\nher colonoscopy was complex , and she had polypectomy of 2.5 cm polyp.\nPath is pending. If + for cancer , the base looked \"clean\" , so may be\nfeasible to re-scope her for surveillance at a later time , as per GI.\n3. HEME- Hct after colonoscopy went to\n24 ( baseline 30 ); post-transfusion HCt of 30.\n5. s/p Renal transplant.
