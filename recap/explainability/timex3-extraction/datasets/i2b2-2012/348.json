{"text": "\nADMISSION DATE : \n3-26-93 \nDISCHARGE DATE : \n4-3-93 \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : \nThe patient is a 73 year old female who was transferred for cardiac catheterization after ventricular fibrillation arrest in the setting of an acute inferior myocardial infarction and a urinary tract infection . \nThe patient was admitted on 3-16-93 to Diy Hospital for an E. coli urinary tract infection . \nThe patient was readmitted on 3-20-93 because of fever , chills and a sudden onset of ventricular fibrillation arrest , successfully cardioverted back to rapid atrial fibrillation and finally to sinus rhythm , where an electrocardiogram then showed ST elevation in inferior leads . \nPeak CPK was 2494 with 18% MB 's . \nShe required intubation for mild to moderate congestive heart failure , treated with diuretics , intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin . \nShe had post-infarction angina , was transferred here for angiography and possible percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . \nHOSPITAL COURSE : \nOn 3-27-93 , patient underwent cardiac catheterization , coronary and left ventricular angiography without complications . \nReview of these angiograms demonstrated a dominant right coronary artery with a focal 50% stenosis in the mid-portion . \nThe left main coronary artery was clear . \nThe left anterior descending had moderate plaques with a 50% proximal stenosis of the right anterior oblique caudal view . \nThe proximal diagonal D1 had a 50% stenosis . \nThe circumflex had a long 30% stenosis proximally and an 80% stenosis at the origin of the second major marginal artery . \nThe left ventricular angiogram showed akinesis of the posterobasal walls , severe hypokinesis of the diaphragmatic wall and trace mitral regurgitation . \nThe patient was maintained on heparin anticoagulation . \nAn exercise tolerance test with Thallium was to be performed in order to assess myocardial viability in the infarct zone . \nThe right coronary artery lesion was complex and there was severe stenosis in the obtuse marginal 1 . \nThe patient had no further angina . \nOn 4-2-93 , she underwent a Persantine Thallium study . \nThis showed no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes for ischemia and no angina pectoris . \nThe thallium images showed a large region of persistently reduced blood flow involving the apex and inferoposterior segments of the left ventricular wall . \nThis was consistent with scar . \nThere was no definite perfusion abnormality in the circumflex zone . \nIn view of these findings , it was elected to discharge her on her present medical program . \nThe patient is to return to the follow up care of Dr. Ko Kollciem at the Diy Hospital . \nCHPO E.
