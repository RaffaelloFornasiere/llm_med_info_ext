He had\nrecurrent ischemic symptoms four months later and cardiac\ncatheterization showed restenosis of his LAD with an 80% lesion\nat D3. He had brachytherapy and repeat PTCA. Since then , he has\ndone well but he had increasing dyspnea from CR. Exercise\nthallium test , which showed increasing LV filling pressures\nduring exercise and inferior apical ischemia. He was admitted\nfor cardiac catheterization , which was done on 6/14/06 and the\npatient was found to have a 45% proximal right coronary artery\ndisease , 50% distal left main disease , and 95% mid LAD disease.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nSignificant for hypertension , dyslipidemia , and chest radiation ,\nprostate cancer , osteoporosis , and urinary incontinence.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\nHe was admitted , made ready for surgery. He was taken to the\noperating room on 10/3/06. At which time , he underwent a CABG\nx3 with a LIMA to the LAD , a saphenous vein graft to the PDA and\na saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal. The patient's\naortic valve was only found to be mildly stenotic with the valve\narea of 1.4 and a peak gradient of 30. This was discussed with\nhis cardiologist , Dr. Cletus Columbres and a combined decision was made\nnot to replace the aortic valve at this time. The patient's\nimmediate postoperative course was uncomplicated. He was\ntransferred to the Intensive Care Unit in a stable fashion. He\nwas found to have an inferior lateral ischemia on EKG , therefore ,\nhe was taken to the cath lab , all grafts were found to be patent\nand there was resolution of ischemia. He was weaned off his pressors and he\nwas extubated.\nHe was found to be hemodynamically\nstable. He was started on Lopressor and gentle diuresis. On\npostoperative day #3 , we titrated up his Lopressor and started on\nhis Norvasc and transferred him to the Step-Down Unit. On\npostoperative day #4 , he was slightly tachycardic with ambulation\nand we titrated up on his beta-blockers. PA and chest x-ray look\ngood. Physical therapy was consulted to decide whether the\npatient would benefit from rehabilitation. He was started on\nempiric levofloxacin for questionable pneumonia. He was found\nsuitable for discharge on postoperative day #5 , however , the\npatient had isolated temperature and his white count was found to\nbe trending and he was hypertensive. The patient was found to\nhave a positive blood culture from when he had been in the\nIntensive Care Unit and he was continued on levofloxacin. The\npatient was discovered to have left leg cellulitis at the knee\nwhere his saphenous vein graft was harvested from. He was\nstarted on vancomycin. This area continued to be watched while\nthe patient remained on IV antibiotics. He was afebrile. His\nwhite blood cell count was 12. The patient remained stable but\nhe continued to have a white count and left\nleg ultrasound finally done on postoperative day #10 , revealed a\nfluid collection above the knee to the mid calf mostly behind his\nknee where the area of erythema was and his white blood cell\ncount went up to 15. Therefore , on 10/28/06 , the patient was\ntaken to the operating room , at which time , he underwent a\ndrainage and irrigation of his left lower extremity saphenous\nvein donor site , moderate amount of fluid were expressed , and\ncultures were taken. The patient was transferred back to the\nStep-Down Unit after this procedure. Please see the continuing\ndictation done by Valentin Krull for the rest of the patient's\nhospital course and discharge status.\neScription document: 4-5978600 EMSSten Tel\nDictated By: FRENKEL , EMIL\nAttending: FINLEY , RYAN\nDictation ID 5169133\nD: 10/5/06\nT: 10/5/06\n[report_end]\n", "annotations": [{"medication_name": "pressors", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "37"}, {"medication_name": "lopressor", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "40"}, {"medication_name": "lopressor", "medication_dosage": "titrated up", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "41"}, {"medication_name": "norvasc", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "42"}, {"medication_name": "beta-blockers.", "medication_dosage": "titrated up", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "44"}, {"medication_name": "levofloxacin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "47"}, {"medication_name": "levofloxacin.", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "52"}, {"medication_name": "vancomycin.", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "55"}, {"medication_name": "antibiotics.", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "iv", "frequency": "", "line": "56"}]}
