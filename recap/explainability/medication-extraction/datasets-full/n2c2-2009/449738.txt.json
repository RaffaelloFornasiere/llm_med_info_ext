In the prior 2 weeks , he had been started on\nhydrochlorothiazide. He had been nauseated and vomiting as a\nresult of Percocet taken for his left hip pain with resulting\ndecreased p.o. intake. He was evaluated in his primary care\nclinic and felt to be in decompensated heart failure.\nIn the Emergency Department , he was dehydrated and found to be in\nacute renal failure , hyperkalemic , and uremic. He complained of\njoint soreness , particularly in his third proximal\ninterphalangeal joints bilaterally. His BUN and creatinine were\n182 and 4.8 respectively. His potassium 6.4 , his sodium 128 , and\nhis CPK 1356 , and his uric acid level 11.6. Issues in the\nhospital included hyperkalemia , acute renal failure secondary to\ndehydration , polyarticular joint soreness and left hip pain. For\nhis hyperkalemia , the patient was treated with calcium ,\ngluconate , insulin , Kayexalate and his potassium level returned\nto normal levels by hospital day #2. For his acute renal\nfailure , the patient was hydrated gently with 60 cc of normal\nsaline. The renal service was consulted and assisted with\nmanagement. The patient was urinating. Renal ultrasound was\nnormal. Renal function returned to baseline and his creatinine\nat discharge was 1.4. His baseline is 1.6. With correction of\nhis renal function , the patient regained strength. For his joint\nsymptoms , Rheumatology was consulted who performed arthrocentesis\nof the left knee and diagnosed polyarticular gout. No treatment\nwas initiated in the setting of impaired renal function and a\nconcern for fluid retention. He has a followup appointment with\nRheumatology in July 2005. For his hip pain , his orthopedist ,\nDr. Schuchmann , evaluated him for possible future hip surgery.\nNeurology was consulted regarding atrophy of thenar muscles and\nelevated CPK. They did not feel a secure diagnosis could be made\nand recommended following daily CPK , which trended down over the\ncourse of hospitalization. Followup appointment in Neurology was\nscheduled to discuss essential tremor and further investigate the\nmuscle wasting with nerve conduction studies and EMG if necessary\nbased on CPK levels. The patient had an echocardiogram on\nhospital day #2 , which showed an ejection fraction of 40 to 45% ,\nno pericardial effusion , and hypokinesis of the mid and distal\nseptum , mid and distal inferior wall and decreased global right\nventricular function. The patent foramen ovale was visualized.\nAt discharge , the patient was afebrile , hemodynamically stable ,\neuvolemic , ambulating , and saturating on room air , and on a\nstable medical regimen. He was followed by VNA at home starting\nFebruary , 2005 , for INR checks.\nFollowup appointments for Cardiology , Neurology , and Rheumatology\nwere put in place. The patient was asked to contact his primary\ncare physician to schedule a followup appointment.\nOn admission , the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically\nstable.\neScription document: 6-5164249 SSSten Tel\nDictated By: PIERMONT , FLOYD\nAttending: SULESKI , CHADWICK ANTONIO\nDictation ID 0550727\nD: 8/24/05\nT: 8/24/05\n[report_end]\n", "annotations": [{"medication_name": "hydrochlorothiazide.", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "19"}, {"medication_name": "percocet", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "20"}, {"medication_name": "calcium", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "31"}, {"medication_name": "gluconate", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "32"}, {"medication_name": "insulin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "32"}, {"medication_name": "kayexalate", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "32"}, {"medication_name": "normal saline.", "medication_dosage": "60 cc", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "34"}]}
