He is admitted on January , 1999 for coronary artery bypass grafting.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Psoriasis and polymyalgia rheumatica ,\ncoronary artery disease and wide eye\nglaucoma. His echocardiogram demonstrated left ventricular\nhypertrophy with a normal ejection fraction. He has a 45 year\nhistory of smoking.\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Prednisone 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 )\nLasix 40 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Zocor 40\nmg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day. 5 ) Nitropatch.\n6 ) Enteric coated aspirin p.o. q. day. 7 ) Timolol eye drops to\nhis left eye. 8 ) Captopril 18.75 mg p.o. three times a day. 9 )\nTagamet 50 mg p.o. twice a day. 10 ) Calcium supplementation.\nLABORATORY: Laboratory studies on admission revealed a BUN of 20 ,\ncreatinine 1.2 , white blood cell count 8.8 , hematocrit\n40.2.

His intraoperative course was\nuncomplicated. On postoperative day number one , he was weaned to\nextubation and he was treated with stress steroids to prevent\nsteroid withdrawal.

He was sent to the step down unit on routine\npostoperative day number two and his Captopril was increased for\nafterload reduction. His course improved and he was diuresed for a\nvolume overload still requiring oxygen supplementation on two\nliters. His oxygen saturation was only 91% on postoperative day\nnumber three.
