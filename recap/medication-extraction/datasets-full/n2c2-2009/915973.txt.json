The patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple\nmedical problems including severe COPD , ( on home O2 2 liters\nbaseline sat below 90s ) , nonsmall cell lung cancer , diagnosed in\n1999 status post multiple chemotherapy regimens , most recently\nALIMTA from 1/29/2005 to 09 , diabetes , obesity , and\nchronic renal insufficiency , who was admitted to MICU on\n2/19/2005 for neutropenia , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain ,\nshortness of breath , requiring intubation , hypertension , prerenal\nazotemia with a creatinine of 2.9; all of which are believed to\nbe secondary to sepsis.\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Included Avapro , Lipitor , Decadron ,\nranitidine , Humalog , allopurinol , Alimta , Flonase , vitamin D ,\nB12 , and Colace.\nALLERGIES: Bactrim , resulting in acute renal failure and\nhyperkalemic , and penicillin resulting in anaphylaxis.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Pertinent for the fact that she lives at home.\nShe has a remote history of smoking , quit 15 years ago , and\ndenies alcohol.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Pertinent for hypertension , stroke , thyroid\ncancer , and cervical cancer.\nFINDINGS ON ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Shows a temperature\nof 98.9. pulse of 116 , and blood pressure 84/47 , and 96% on\nventilation. General exam: She is an obese female , intubated\nand awake , motioning to take her tube out. Skin exam showed\nscattered group petechial areas over the torso , abdomen , and\nunder the right breast. HEENT Exam shows pupils equal , round ,\nand reactive and anicteric , with a normal JVP. Pulmonary exam\nshows decreased mildly decreased breath sounds at the right base.\nNo crackles , increase in expiratory phase , few scattered rales.\nCardiac exam shows tachycardia otherwise regular rhythm. A 2/6\nsystolic murmur across precordium. Abdomen is soft , obese ,\npositive bowel sounds , nontender , and nondistended with chronic\nskin changes below the pannus. Extremities show trace to 1+\nedema to the shins , with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.\nNeurologic , the patient is awake; however , the exam is otherwise\ndifficult to perform secondary to the patient being intubated.\nPERTINENT LABS ON ADMISSION: Show a white count of 0.74 with 46%\npolys and 6% bands , resulting in an absolute neutrophil count of\n340 , a hematocrit of 26.2 , and platelets of 37. Creatinine of\n3.1 , a PTT of 83.5 and INR of 1.4 , and lactic acid of 1.4.\nChest x-ray on admission shows right infrahilar mass , bibasilar\nopacities , with chronic alveolar disease versus new fusions , I\ncannot rule out infiltrate. Abdominal CT shows small bowel wall\nthickening and left-sided atelectasis versus pneumonia.\nPROCEDURES: Status post intubation and extubation.\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:\n1. Infectious disease: Ms. Dozois was admitted with fever and\nhypertension , and I was concerned for sepsis , I initially thought\nnosocomial pneumonia versus GI as the primary source. She\nrequired intubation and pressors , and was started on vancomycin ,\nLevaquin , and aztreonam along with Flagyl empirically. Her urine\ngrew Enterococcus and she was changed to Levaquin only on\n10/25/2005 to treat an enterococcal UTI and possible nosocomial\npneumonia. An abdominal CT was obtained , which shows small bowel\nwall thickening and injection of the SMA territory concerning for\na neutropenic enteritis. Surgery was consulted and she was\nmanaged conservatively with antibiotics initially and then with\nbowel rest. She is no longer neutropenic and was off Neupogen\nover a week prior to discharge. She was afebrile over the last\nweek and will stay and finish the 14-day course of Levaquin for\nUTI.\n2. GI: Ms. Lorts was treated with bowel rest for her neutropenic\nenteritis and once she was no longer neutropenic without\nabdominal pain , she was started on clear liquid diet. However ,\nshe developed intermittent GI bleed , secondary to likely\nsloughing of her mucosa status post neutropenic enteritis. GI\nwas consulted and she was again placed on bowel rest. Though ,\nshe has a history of colonic polyps , GI also felt that the\nculprit of her GI bleed is mucosal sloughing as well. She\ncontinued to have intermittent episodes of bloody diarrhea\nwhenever she was re challenged with p.o. intake. Her C-diff is\nnegative. Colonoscopy was deferred secondary to\nthrombocytopenia. She required multiple red blood transfusions\nto maintain her hematocrit greater than 26 , though she was never\nhemodynamically unstable. Finally , after given sustained bowel\nrest , her blood stools resolved , and she was able to tolerate\noral contrast and an abdominal CT on 6/30/2005 showed no small\nbowel wall thickening or any other intraabdominal process causing\nher symptoms. Her diet was advanced , and she was tolerating\nregular diet at the time of discharge without problems.\n3. COPD: On home O2 , typically requiring 2 liters with baseline\nsat over 90s. Ms. Shubrick was intubated on admission for increased\nshortness of breath and hypoxia. She was extubated the following\nday on 4/16/2005 .  She requires BiPAP nightly , now stable on 2\nto 4 liters nasal cannula during the day.\n4. Heme: On chemotherapy induced anemia with hematocrit drop on\nadmission to 21 from the baseline of around 26. She responded\nwell initially to three units of packed red blood cells over\n7/28/2005 and 09 .  However , in the setting of her GI\nbleed from a sloughing mucosa secondary to resolving neutropenic\nenteritis and recent chemo , she required multiple further RBC\ntransfusions to keep her hematocrit greater than 30. She was\nalso thrombocytopenic , status post chemo and required multiple\nplatelet transfusions to keep her platelets greater than 30 , 000.\nHematology was consulted secondary to suboptimal busted platelet\nlevels status post transfusions , which was felt to be secondary\nto poor marrow response in the setting of recent chemo ( workup\nwas negative for other possible causes refractory\nthrombocytopenia , nystatin , allopurinol , were held given possible\nworsening of her thrombocytopenia ). On discharge her hematocrit\nand platelets were stable respectively at 29.8 and 46 , 000 and she\nhad not required a transfusion in greater than 24 hours prior to\ndischarge.\n5. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's baseline\ncreatine is 1.7; however , on admission it was noted to be 3 ,\nlikely secondary to hypovolemia from vomiting and diarrhea ( FENa\nwas 0.22% ). Her creatinine is now back to baseline with\nhydration. Her creatinine was 1.1 prior to discharge.\n6. Nonsmall cell lung cancer: The patient is on Alimta started\nfor her neutropenia , which has since resolved. She will follow\nwith her oncologist Dr. Ervin Tonrey for further therapy.\n7. Endocrine: Because of her insulin-dependent diabetes , the\npatient was placed on portland protocol while on the stress dose.\nSteroids were discontinued on 10/25/2005 and she passed a\ncortisol stimulation test on 10/25/2005 as well. She was changed\nto standing insulin on 10/25/2005 and her Lantus was up titrated\nalong with sliding scale insulin to maintain blood sugars in the\n80s to 120s. She will return home on her home regimen.\n8. FEN: TPN was started on 4/21/2005 , given her bowel rest for\npossible neutropenic enteritis. She restarted p.o. intake on\n9/2/2005 and tolerated advancement to diabetic diet , and she\nwas weaned off her TPN prior to discharge.\nCONSULTANTS: General Surgery , Hematology , and Gastroenterology.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE: Vital signs: T max 98 , blood\npressure 120/60 , pulse 88 , and respirations 20 sating at 95% on\n3.5 liters of oxygen. General exam shows an obese female resting\nand in no acute distress. Nasal cannula in place. HEENT Exam\nwas normocephalic , atraumatic. Pulmonary exam showed decreased\nair entry , decreased breath sounds , but otherwise no obvious\nwheezes or rhonchi. Cardiovascular exam shows regular rate and\nrhythm , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops , but decreased heart sounds.\nAbdominal exam shows an obese abdomen , nontender , nondistended ,\npositive bowel sounds. Extremities show 1 to 2+ edema\nbilaterally to the knee. Skin exam shows a area where left\ninternal jugular line was removed and the site is intact and\ndressed. Improved erythema in her intertriginous areas.\nNeurologic exam shows the patient is alert and oriented x3\nwithout any focal neurologic deficits.\nThe patient was discharged in stable condition and she will\nfollow up with Dr. Marco Derosset in one week.\nThe patient is full code.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 to 1000 mg p.o. q. 6h p.r.n.\npain , headache , if fever is greater than 101 ,
