Pre-gestational diabetes.\n2. History of coronary artery disease.\n3. Recurrent SABs\n4. Hepatitis B.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 36-year-old G16 ,\nP0-0-15-0 , who presented at 6 and 4/7 weeks by LMP\nconsistent with ultrasound of the day of admission , as a transfer\nfrom the High-Risk Obstetric Clinic , admitted to the Fuller\nAntepartum Service for diabetic control. The patient had\npresented to the Special OB Clinic as a new patient for prenatal\ncare. Review of her medical problems revealed that the recent\nglucose control had been suboptimal. In view of this and in view\nof the fact that the patient had multiple other issues , the\npatient was admitted for diabetic control , adjustment of her\ninsulin regimen and evaluation regarding the other medical\nproblems.\nHistory of present pregnancy: the patient had a last\nmenstrual period in the second week of March . Ultrasound on the\nday of admission , 11/2/07 , revealed a 6.6-week intrauterine\npregnancy with a fetal heart rate of 110. The estimated date of\nconfinement is 4/22/07. Prenatal screening labs were pending at\nthe time of admission. The patient has blood group O +ve.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of ST elevation\nmyocardial infarction in 2000. The infarct was a presumed\nembolism to the left anterior descending and the left circumflex coronary\nartery. The complete occlusion of the mid-to-distal left\nanterior descending artery , which was thought to be due to\nthrombosis , was treated with TPA and angioplasty. The patient had\na normal catheterization in March 2000. The last echocardiogram\nrevealed an ejection fraction of 45% in 2002; however , the\npatient never had a repeat echo since that time. On the day of\nadmission , the patient reported that she was able to climb four\nflights of stairs to her apartment , haveing to pause after two flights of\nstairs to catch her breath.\nIn addition , the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus , diagnosed in 2000.\nThe patient had a medical admission in 2006 for hypoglycemia when she\nincidentally injected Humalog instead of Lantus. On the day of admission , the\npatient was on a Humalog 7 units b.i.d. and Lantus 12 units in\nthe evening. Her fasting sugars were in the 150s before admission and her\nblood sugar measurements were over 200 in the evening. On the day of\nadmission , the fasting sugar was 123.\nIn addition , the patient has a history of hepatitis B ,\ndiagnosed in 2005. The patient had a positive E antigen in 2005.\nShe had previously been on Epivir 150 mg p.o. daily , but this\nwas stopped prior to the current pregnancy.\nPAST OB/GYN HISTORY: The patient has a history of a fibroid\nuterus , and a history of recurrent miscarriages. In terms of the\nfibroid uterus , the patient did report pelvic pain in the\noutpatient setting. Ultrasound had shown an 8-10 cm\ndominant posterior fibroid. The patient occasionally takes\noxycodone for fibroid pain.\nIn terms of the patient's recurrent miscarriages , the patient had fifteen SABs\nin the past with over 10 dilatation and evacuations , including one molar\npregnancy with subsequent choriocarcinoma. All losses were in the first\ntrimester , less than 12 weeks' gestation. The patient had been\nevaluated previously for a thrombophilia workup , but this had\nbeen negative multiple times aside from a MTHFR gene mutation ,\nwhich was noted on this admission , and it is unclear whether this\nhas been addressed previously. The patient had previously been\ntold by a reproductive endocrinologist , that she should consider\nadoption or a gestational carrier. Chromosomes on several\npathology specimens from the previous abortions showed\naneuploidy.\nThe patient currently denies a history of sexually\ntransmitted infections. She has a history of cervical dysplasia ,\nwith a history of CIN I and CIN II in 1990 and 1992. She\nunderwent a LEEP in 1992 , which was consistent with HSIL. All\nsubsequent Pap smears were either within normal limits. Last Pap\nsmear done in February 2006 at Rexmo Sha Hospital Of was insufficient for\nanalysis. In terms of the patient's history of choriocarcinoma , the patient\nhad a molar pregnancy , which then developed into a subsequent choriocarcinoma.\nFor this , the patient was treated with methotrexate , actinomycin D and Cytoxan ,\nthen VP-16 , cisplatin and bleomycin with presumed cure.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Dilatation and evacuation x10 ,\nhysteroscopy for infertility workup , and LEEP.\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Humalog Insulin 7 units twice a day ,\nLantus 12 units in the evening , aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily stopped\nprior to pregnancy , history of lamivudine/Epivir use , 150 daily\nstopped prior to current pregnancy.\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Former smoker , given up smoking in 2000 after a\nmyocardial infarct. No history of alcohol abuse or IV drug use.\nThe patient lives in Doreska Dr , Nah Min Knox with her boyfriend , unemployed.\nFAMILY HISTORY: No history of GYN malignancies , history of\nmaternal diabetes , longstanding. Father with coronary artery\ndisease in his 50s.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for the primary\npurpose of diabetic control.\n1. Diabetes mellitus. The patient had reported poor diabetic\ncontrol as an outpatient. Therefore , her regimen was continued ,\nwith the addition of a sliding scale , in order to determine the\nadditional insulin needs as an outpatient. Over the course of\nthe admission , the patient's Lantus was increased to 20 units at\nnighttime , and she was using 8 units three times a day of insulin\nlispro , in addition to a lispro sliding scale. With this\nregimen , the fingerstick glucose control improved , and the\nfasting blood sugar on the day of discharge was 90. On the day\nprior to discharge , the patient had blood sugars in the range\nfrom 93 to 139. An HbA1c was sent , which was 6.7 , during this\nadmission , the patient also had a Nutrition consult. She will be\nfollowed in the High-Risk Obstetric and Diabetic Clinic by Dr.\nBorguez\n2. Cardiology. The patient was restarted on her aspirin , given\nher history of myocardial infarct at a very early age. In\naddition , an echocardiogram was obtained on the day after\nadmission. This revealed an ejection fraction of 50% as well as\na large left ventricular thrombosis , which was presumed to be a\nlongstanding. Cardiology was consulted and the impression was\nthat the thrombosis was likely a combination of her left\nventricular hypokinesia related to the previous infarct , as well\nas her hypercoagulable state. Therefore , their recommendation\nwas to start the patient on Lovenox for the duration of this\npregnancy , which adjusted for her weight was a dose of 90 mg\ndaily , followed by a transition to Coumadin postpartum , to be\ncontinued for likely long-term , possibly lifelong duration. The\nCardiology Consult Team noted that the MTHFR mutation had not\nresulted in elevated homocysteine levels in the past. However ,\nthey did agree that folate supplementation at high doses was\nindicated. The patient will be continued on Lovenox 90 mg daily\nsubcutaneously , and aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily as an outpatient.\nShe will have Cardiology followup with Dr. Jasper Erps on\n11/27/07. During the entire admission , she was hemodynamically\nstable , in sinus rhythm , with no complaints of chest pain ,\nshortness of breath or palpitations.\n3. Hepatitis B. The patient had liver function tests and a\nhepatitis panel on this admission , given her history of active\ndisease diagnosed in 2005 , with a positive hepatitis E antigen.\nOn admission , the patient had not been on Epivir , which had been\nstopped prior to this current pregnancy. Liver function tests\nwere checked on this admission and were within normal limits. In\naddition , serologies were checked and the hepatitis E antigen and\nthe E antibody was negative. Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B\ncore antigen were reactive. At the time of this dictation , a\nhepatitis B viral load was pending. Given the patient's history\nof hepatitis B , an outpatient appointment was being arranged at\nthe time of discharge , with Dr. Lavy , from the Division of\nGastroenterology at the Sasspan Hospital . It was\ndecided that the patient should not take any lamivudine until\nGastroenterology followup. During the entire hospital stay , the\npatient did not have any GI complaints , was tolerating a regular\ndiet , and having normal regular bowel movements.\n4. history of fibroids , the patient was noted again to have an 8-cm fibroid\non her ultrasound scan. She required rare intermittent doses of\noxycodone as required for pain , which was presumed to be related\nto her fibroid uterus.\n5. Prenatal care. The patient had her first trimester labs sent\non this admission. GC and chlamydia testing were negative.\nUrine culture was negative. The patient was O +ve. Given the\npatient's history of MTHFR mutation and the recurrent SABs , the\npatient was started on prenatal vitamins , as well as high-dose\nfolic acid , B12 and B6. In view of the patient's diabetic\nhistory , and a transiently elevated creatinine to 1.2 on hospital\nday 2 , which went back to 0.7 on the day of discharge , the\npatient had a 24-hour urine collection sent , this returned\nnegative at 92 mg per 24 hours. It was noted that the patient\nhad an Ophthalmology retinal exam at an outside hospital health\ncenter this year. For the remainder of this pregnancy , it was\nnoted that the patient will require ultrasounds at 11 and 17\nweeks , as well as a fetal echo , and the recommended testing for\npre-gestational diabetics for the remainder of the pregnancy.\nThe patient was discharged in a stable condition , with followup\nappointments arranged for the various specialties.\nDISPOSITION: Home without services.\nDISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1.
