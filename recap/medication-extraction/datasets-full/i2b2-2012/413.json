{"text": "\nADMISSION DATE :\n5-3-93\nDISCHARGE DATE :\n5-12-93\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nMr. Stain was transferred from the Oreiewlefell Merkane I Penaltbridgesgreat University Medical Center for progressive respiratory failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome superimposed on a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , perhaps asthma , and ulcerative colitis .\nHis only positive result was a sputum culture for Pseudomonas and this came after he had already been on antibiotics .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Wire who felt that manipulation of the tracheal tube was the best approach to the air leak since it was a new trach and he was requiring such high ventilator support that it was risky to change it .\nHe also felt that lung biopsy at this time was rather risky .\nThe patient was therefore completely cultured again and begun on antibiotic coverage which would take care of the Pseudomonas he was known to have .\nThe steroids were tapered .\nHe was also begun on anti-Candida regimen for his urinary tract infection with yeast being seen .\nBecause of the story of hemoptysis , he also underwent an exotic bleeding work up for such things as Wegner &apos;s and Goodpasture &apos;s .\nThese results were all negative .\nHe continued to require very high FIO2 .\nHe was found to have a DVT by ultrasound .\nHe underwent a trial of TPA followed by heparin .\nThis produced substantially further hemoptysis and the need for transfusion .\nHe stabilized from this , but on the fifth while continuing to have extremely ventilator requirement .\nIn consultation with his family , it was decided that enough support had been done .\nAt that time , therefore , ventilator support was withdrawn under the comfort measures of morphine .\nSTAIN J.
