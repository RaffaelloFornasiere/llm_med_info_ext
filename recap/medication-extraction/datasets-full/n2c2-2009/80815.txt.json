He had a\npast medical history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and recent\ncomplex medical history including a septic right knee arthritis\nwith MRSA complicated by a PICC line-induced right upper extremity\nDVT followed by bacteremia with multi-resistant Klebsiella\npneumoniae , treated with meropenem for 14 days with the course\nending on 11/12/2006. The patient presented with left lower quadrant abdominal\npain during his last admission 2 weeks ago associated with low-volume mucus\ndiarrhea , C. diff toxin assay was at that time negative on 6/11\nAbdominal CT showed diverticulosis with stranding of the sigmoid colon.\nBlood cultures grew klebsiella , treated with 14 days of meropenem\nas previously noted. However , since this discharge , the mild\nabdominal pain persisted. He continues to have low-grade mucus\ndiarrhea about 5 times a day , not associated with fever , chills\nor anorexia. Over the last 2 days prior to this admission , the\ndiarrhea became high volume , still nonbloody and not associated\nagain with fever or chills. He was brought into the emergency\ndepartment at which time , he was afebrile with a blood pressure\nof 85/49 , heart rate in the 80s , respiratory rate of 20 , O2\nsaturation 93% on room air. At that time , he received volume\nresuscitation with 2 liters of IV fluids , stool samples for C.\ndiff assay were sent. He received empiric therapy with p.o.\nvancomycin. An abdominal CT in the emergency department showed\nthickening of the sigmoid colon and rectum.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes coronary artery disease as noted\nwith an anterior MI in 2003 , that had complicated to VT arrest ,\nstatus post CABG in 2003 that was a left internal mammary artery\nto LAD with saphenous vein graft to the PTA and obtuse marginal.\nHe has had a catheterization in 8/23 that showed patent grafts\nand drug-eluting stent to the left circumflex. He has chronic\nkidney disease , baseline creatinine between 1.3 and 1.5 ,\nhypertension , hypercholesterolemia , C. diff colitis in 2003 , BPH ,\nasthma , GERD , status post right upper extremity PICC-related DVT\nand right knee septic arthritis.\nMEDICATIONS: aspirin 81 mg , Plavix 75 mg , Coumadin 5 mg , digoxin 0.125 mg ,\nLasix 49 mg daily , lisinopril 10 mg daily , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 80 mg\ndaily , Flomax 0.4 mg daily and Flovent 110 mcg b.i.d.\nALLERGIES: penicillin which caused hives and swelling.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: He previously a smoker. He does not drink. He\nis a nursing home resident.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease , two\nbrothers who had coronary artery disease in their 60s. No family\nhistory of cancer.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vitals as previous noted , blood pressure\nin the 80s/49 , heart rate 80 , regular , respiratory rate 20 , O2\nsaturation 93% on room air. Patient was afebrile. Pertinent\nphysical findings included: Pulmonary: He had a prolonged\nexpiratory phase , but no crackles. Cardiovascular: Distant heart\nsounds , regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. No rubs or\ngallops. Systolic ejection or murmur 3/6 at the left lower\nsternal border. Abdomen: Obese , distended abdomen , left lower\nquadrant tenderness to palpation. No rebound at this time.\nExtremities are warm , 2+ pulses with 1+ bilateral lower extremity\nedema to the shins. Neurologic: Alert and oriented x3 , cranial\nnerves grossly intact , no abnormalities.\nadmission abdominal CT showed bowel wall thickening in\nthe descending sigmoid colon and rectum. Chest x-ray showed\nleft-sided pleural effusion , atelectasis in the left lower lobe.\nLABORATORY DATA: Labs were significant for a white count of\n15.7 , hematocrit of 35.5 and INR of 3.2. Electrolytes were\nnormal.\nPatient was initially admitted to the MICU for hypertension and\ninfectious etiology. He was stabilized there and transferred to\nthe floor within a few days.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\n1. Colitis , presumed infectious etiology , descending and sigmoid\ncolon. Colitis was worse over the last month , associated with\ndiarrhea. Abdominal CT is consistent with an infectious\ninflammatory bowel process. Given history of C. diff colitis , C.\ndiff was the most likely infectious etiology , but others were\npossible. Ischemic colitis was considered secondary to low\nforward flow , given patient's cardiomyopathy and low ejection\nfraction of 20% to 35% and he also got a pattern of inflammatory\ncolitis or nonspecific colitis. Stool samples were sent for a C.\ndiff toxin and assay and all were negative x at least 3 samples.\nStool cultures were sent and did not grow anything out during\nadmission. Empiric treatment was started with p.o. vancomycin.\nPatient's abdominal pain continued to improve and completely\nresolved. By discharge , patient remained afebrile and white\nblood cell count decreased. Advance patient's diet as tolerated\nand by discharge the patient was up to soft solids. We added\nlactobacillus p.o. for probiotics and patient also had flex sig\ntwo days before discharge , showing resolving inflammation\nconsistent with colitis of inflammatory etiology. The flex sig\ndid not change his management. We did discharge the patient on a\n2-week course p.o. vancomycin alone.\n2. Coronary artery disease. Patient had no evidence for acute\ncoronary syndrome on admission. We continued his aspirin ,\nPlavix , statin and beta-blocker. Patient had no ischemic issues\nor coronary artery disease issues during his admission.\n3. CHF. Patient has previous EF noted at 20% to 35% , so a\ngentle hydration therapy at first in the MICU for hypertension\nand then as patient's blood pressure increased , was able to\nrestart patient's Lasix dose in order to diurese all of the extra\nfluid gained during the rehydration therapy , was restarted on the\nLasix 40 mg p.o. daily , his daily dose at home. Also considered\nrestarting lisinopril , but deferred discharge to outpatient\nfollow up with primary care physician for restart of lisinopril ,\nonce patient is fully recovered.\n4. Chronic kidney disease. Patient had a baseline of creatinine\n1.2 to 1.5 and he came into the hospital with a creatinine of 1.0.\nThe patient was below baseline and remained below baseline during\nadmission. He did not have any renal issues.\n5. Hematology. Patient has a history a line-induced DVT , has\nbeen treated with Coumadin , with no definitive evidence as to how\nalong patient should be treated , given that the DVT was line\ninduced. Coumadin was therapeutic on admission , became\nsupertherapeutic in the MICU. Held Coumadin until INR fell below\n3 , restarted Coumadin afterwards at 6 mg p.o. daily , patient's\nnormal dose. Patient was therapeutic on discharge. Will follow\nup with primary care physician for Coumadin monitoring.\n6. Nutrition. Patient was in the MICU and was n.p.o. given\nabdominal pain and colitis. When transferred to floor , was\nstarted on liquid diet and advanced to soft solid diet. By\ndischarge , the patient did not have abdominal pain and most of\nthe diarrhea had resolved.\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED: The patient had a flexible sigmoidoscopy\nduring the admission that showed colitis consistent with\ninflammatory etiology.\nDIAGNOSIS: Patient had repeated negative C. diff toxin assays ,\nbut colitis was presumed to be C. diff and given history , could\nhave been other infectious or inflammatory etiologies. Patient\ncontinued to improve on vancomycin and thus was discharged with\npresumed C. diff colitis diagnosis.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Included aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , Plavix\n75 mg p.o. daily , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily , Nexium 20 mg p.o.\ndaily , Flovent 110 mcg inhale b.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily ,\nlactobacillus 2 tabs p.o. t.i.d. , metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,\nsimvastatin 80 mg p.o. at bed time , Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. every\nevening , vancomycin 250 mg p.o. every 6 hours x8 days at\ndischarge and Coumadin 5 mg p.o. every evening.\nPatient had to follow up with primary care physician , setup for 2\nto 3 weeks after discharge.\neScription document: 5-3515128 HFFocus\nDictated By: SOLLOCK , SHELTON\nAttending: VALLEJOS , JAIME TERRANCE\nDictation ID 6974267\nD: 1/25/06\nT:
