{"text": "RECORD #921741\n\n\n024934655 | GTMHO | 75482269 | | 7544011 | 11/4/2004 12:00:00 AM | CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , CARDIOMYOPATHY | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 4/4/2004 Report Status: Signed\n\nDischarge Date: 5/19/2004\nATTENDING: MILFORD WIZWER M.D.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nThis is a 36-year-old man with a history of a familial\ncardiomyopathy , ejection fraction estimated at around 15% with\nmarked left and right chamber enlargement , severe mitral\nregurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , and PA pressures of 51\nplus right atrium , as per an echo in 2003. He was also status\npost ICD placement in 2001. At baseline , he has a one staircase\nexercise tolerance before becoming short of breath. He also\nadmits that he has been having increasing orthopnea and\nparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He denies , chest pain ,\npalpitations , or peripheral edema. He also has a history of\ndietary fluid intake and medications noncompliance leading to\nheart failure exacerbations. Currently , he states that he has\nbeen eating \"salty foods , \" and has been drinking a lot of extra\nfluids because he has been feeling dry and is not always taking\nhis medications. Consequently , he has noticed a worsening in his\nexercise tolerance , worsening orthopnea , and most notably an\nincrease in abdominal girth. Because of these symptoms\nconsistent with decompensated heart failure , his physicians\nsuggested that he be admitted to the hospital for management of\nhis decompensated heart failure. Of note , he has been previously\non a transplant list , but has been delisted given his\nnoncompliance and continuation of tobacco use.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nIn addition to the cardiomyopathy is chronic renal insufficiency\nwith the creatinine ranging from 1.2 to 3.5 at times.\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\nAldactone 25 mg once a day , K-Dur 40 mEq once a day , lisinopril\n2.5 mg once a day , Isordil 20 mg three times a day , digoxin 0.125\nonce a day , torsemide 200 mg twice , and metolazone p.r.n. for\nvolume overload.\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\nAs mentioned , he is smoking one-half per day of cigarettes ,\noccasional alcohol use , no IV drug use.\nFAMILY HISTORY:\nHis mother , his brother , and his cousin and nephew all have the\nfamilial cardiomyopathy.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nOn the day of admission , he presented with the JVP in the 18 to\n20 range on the physical examination with positive HJR. His\ncardiac exam had a positive S3 of laterally displaced PMI with\nthe right ventricular heave. He also had a 2/6 systolic murmur.\nHis abdomen was distended , nontender , but likely with ascites and\npalpable liver edge. His extremities were warm without edema.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\nFrom the cardiac standpoint , we initially attempted to diurese\nhim IV torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. However , he did not respond well\nenough to this regimen , and therefore we started drip with\nZaroxolyn p.r.n. We also stopped his Isordil and ACE inhibitor\nearly on because of blood pressures in the 80s. On admission ,\nhis creatinine was 2.0 and on the next day of admission , it was\n2.2 with low blood pressures , at which point , we decided to start\na low-dose dopamine drips at 2 mcg per hour. However , his urine\noutput was only about 500 cc negative , so we further increased\nthe Lasix drip from 10 mg an hour to 20 mg an hour after 200 mg\nIV Lasix bolus. On this combination of the Lasix drip at 20 an\nhour and dopamine at 2 mcg per hour , he began to have very good\nand effective urine output at approximately 2-3 liters per day ,\nnegative , also reflected in his total weight , and came in with\nadmission weight of around 90 kg. On each day , he diuresed about\nan half to kilo off until the day of discharge , at which point ,\nhe was less than 86 kg. We monitored strict I's and O's , checked\ndaily weight. During the course of his diuresis , his sodium\nlevels were decreasing mostly secondary to the patient drinking a\nlot of free water. The combination of free water intake in the\nsetting of natriuresis resulted in further worsening of his\nhyponatremia from an admission sodium of 128 to 124 , eventually\nto 122. We strictly reinforce the need to limit his fluid intake\nto less than 2 liters per day , and at that point , his sodium\nlevels than rebounded to 124 and also 128 on the day of\ndischarge. We monitored the b.i.d. lytes. Eventually , his blood\npressures remained stable. His JVP decreased from 18 to 20 on\nadmission to about 10 to 12 and continued to have good urine\noutput , thus we weaned off the dopamine , but continued the Lasix\ndrip for one more day. We then discontinued the Lasix drip and\ntransitioned him back over to torsemide 200 b.i.d. p.o. , which\nwas his home regimen and watch him for another 24 hours. He\ncontinued to diurese at this dose , but then on the day of\ndischarge , his I's and O's were finally about 500 cc negative ,\nwhich is a change from about 1 to 2 liters negative per day. His\nJVP was about 9 to 10 and his creatinine was stable at 1.7. We\nre-added his Isordil at 10 mg t.i.d. for the last 24 hours and\nhis blood pressures were stable in the 90s. Given his potassium ,\nwhich was always borderline low in the 33 or 35 range , we decided\nto increase his Aldactone dose to 25 mg b.i.d. , but given his\nunderlying renal insufficiency , we have decreased his standing\nK-Dur from 40 mEq a day to 20 mEq a day. An echo was done , which\nshowed an ejection fraction of 20% and 4+ MR. They did not\ncomment on the synchrony on the preliminary report. However , he\nis a candidate for Bi-V pacing given his mildly widened QRS\ncomplex stage III heart failure and having been on a very good\nheart failure regimen up until this point.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\nAt discharge , his medical regimen consisted of digoxin 0.125 mg\nonce a day , torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. , Aldactone 25 mg b.i.d. ,\nIsordil 10 mg t.i.d. , and K-Dur 20 mEq. We also added folate 5\nmg to his regimen because he had an elevated homocystine level.\nHe also takes Ambien at night p.r.n. for insomnia.\nDISPOSITION:\nHe is being discharged to home with plan to follow up with Dr.\nGrassi in her Thyroid Clinic on 2/11/05 .  He has been again urged\nto stop smoking and to be complaint with his regimen because he\nis a good heart transplant candidate and for the current time , he\nis not listed given the aforementioned reasons. Overall , Mr.\nPlagmann states that his symptoms have drastically improved. He\nno longer has orthopnea. He is able to exert himself much more\nwithout symptoms of shortness of breath or lightheadedness , and\nhe is eager to go home\neScription document: 3-1999936 EMSSten Tel\nDictated By: BURK , MARIANO\nAttending: MIRICLE , BRENDAN\nDictation ID 9252376\nD: 9/28/04\nT: 9/28/04\n[report_end]\n", "annotations": [{"medication_name": "aldactone", "medication_dosage": "25 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "once a day", "line": "35"}, {"medication_name": "lisinopril", "medication_dosage": "2.5 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "once a day", "line": "35"}, {"medication_name": "k-dur", "medication_dosage": "40 meq", "mode": "", "frequency": "once a day", "line": "35"}, {"medication_name": "isordil", "medication_dosage": "20 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "three times a day", "line": "36"}, {"medication_name": "digoxin", "medication_dosage": "0.125", "mode": "", "frequency": "once a day", "line": "36"}, {"medication_name": "metolazone", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "p.r.n.", "line": "37"}, {"medication_name": "torsemide", "medication_dosage": "200 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "twice", "line": "37"}, {"medication_name": "torsemide", "medication_dosage": "200 mg", "mode": "iv", "frequency": "b.i.d.", "line": "54"}, {"medication_name": "ace inhibitor", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "56"}, {"medication_name": "isordil", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "56"}, {"medication_name": "zaroxolyn", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "drip", "frequency": "p.r.n.", "line": "56"}, {"medication_name": "dopamine", "medication_dosage": "low-dose...2 mcg", "mode": "drips", "frequency": "per hour", "line": "60"}, {"medication_name": "lasix drip", "medication_dosage": "10 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "62"}, {"medication_name": "lasix drip", "medication_dosage": "10 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "an hour", "line": "62"}, {"medication_name": "lasix drip", "medication_dosage": "20", "mode": "", "frequency": "an hour", "line": "63"}, {"medication_name": "lasix bolus.", "medication_dosage": "200 mg", "mode": "iv", "frequency": "", "line": "63"}, {"medication_name": "dopamine", "medication_dosage": "2 mcg", "mode": "", "frequency": "per hour", "line": "64"}, {"medication_name": "lasix drip", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "81"}, {"medication_name": "dopamine", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "81"}, {"medication_name": "lasix", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "drip", "frequency": "", "line": "82"}, {"medication_name": "torsemide", "medication_dosage": "200", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "b.i.d.", "line": "83"}, {"medication_name": "isordil", "medication_dosage": "10 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "t.i.d.", "line": "89"}, {"medication_name": "potassium", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "90"}, {"medication_name": "aldactone", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "92"}, {"medication_name": "aldactone", "medication_dosage": "25 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "b.i.d.", "line": "92"}, {"medication_name": "k-dur", "medication_dosage": "20 meq", "mode": "", "frequency": "a day.", "line": "94"}, {"medication_name": "k-dur", "medication_dosage": "40 meq", "mode": "", "frequency": "a day", "line": "94"}, {"medication_name": "digoxin", "medication_dosage": "0.125 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "once a day", "line": "101"}, {"medication_name": "torsemide", "medication_dosage": "200 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "b.i.d.", "line": "102"}, {"medication_name": "aldactone", "medication_dosage": "25 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "b.i.d.", "line": "102"}, {"medication_name": "isordil", "medication_dosage": "10 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "t.i.d.", "line": "103"}, {"medication_name": "folate", "medication_dosage": "5 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "103"}, {"medication_name": "k-dur", "medication_dosage": "20 meq", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "103"}, {"medication_name": "ambien", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "at night p.r.n.", "line": "105"}]}
