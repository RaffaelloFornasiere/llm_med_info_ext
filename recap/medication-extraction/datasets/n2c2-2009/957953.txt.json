{"text": "RECORD #957953\n\n\n895562413 | REH | 55829947 | | 817500 | 11/16/1990 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Unsigned | DIS | Admission Date: 2/2/1990 Report Status: Unsigned\n\nDischarge Date: 8/0/1990\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 39 year old Wark Na Bo\nfemale with a history of discoid lupus\nand pericarditis , who presents with severe substernal chest pain\nafter having prednisone and Plaquenil discontinued. She first\ndeveloped discoid lupus in 1983. She subsequently over the years\ndeveloped arthralgias of various joints , was treated with aspirin ,\nMotrin and steroids. In 1985 , she developed pleuritic substernal\nchest pain. She was diagnosed at Westten Hospital with pericarditis\nand underwent pericardiocentesis. In 1988 , she was seen at the\nArthritis Clinic by Dr. Goerlitz , who noted a discoid lupus on\nexamination , a mild anemia , sedimentation rate 85 , CH-50 178 , VNA\npositive at 1:160 , positive anti-double-stranded DNA and 3+\npositive Smith/anti-Smith antibody. She was treated with Plaquenil\n200 bid , plus aspirin and Naprosyn. In 22 of May , she was diagnosed\nwith a lupus flare and was put on prednisone 30 q am. She did well\nand in 23 of March the steroids were tapered off and discontinued.\nHowever , she presented with substernal chest pain at that time and\nhad her prednisone restarted. She was put on another prednisone\ntaper. In 26 of May , she had a negative brain magnetic resonance\nimaging. In 1 of October , she had an echocardiogram which showed\npericardial thickening without evidence of constriction consistent\nwith prior pericarditis. Over the following several months , she\nhad occasional flares because of medical noncompliance. She was\nput on Plaquenil 200 bid , which was increased to tid , and Motrin\n800 bid. In 15 of January , she again came to the emergency room with\nsubsternal chest pain and a mild pulsus paradoxus , no jugular\nvenous distention. An electrocardiogram was without change. Chest\nx-ray showed slight increase in the heart size. She was placed on\nprednisone 30 q day , Tylenol with codeine and did well. On\n21 of January , she was seen in the clinic and had substernal chest pain\nconsistent with pericardial pain , dyspnea on exertion , increased\narthralgias secondary to discontinuing her steroids. At that time ,\nshe had her Plaquenil and prednisone restarted. Over the last 3\nweeks prior to admission she noticed that the prednisone and\nPlaquenil increased stomachaches and she stopped the medication.\nOver the last 7 days prior to admission , she has had increasing\ndyspnea on exertion and substernal chest pain , which is sharp ,\nincreases with cough or deep breaths. She denied any orthopnea or\nparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations or syncope. She has no\nnausea , vomiting , fevers , chills or melena. She does have\nincreasing joint pain. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY revealed seizure\ndisorder with Dilantin , hypothyroidism treated with L-thyroxine ,\niron deficiency anemia without prior work-up , thoracic spine\ncompression fractures , gastritis questionably secondary to\nNaprosyn. She has no known ALLERGIES. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION\nwere Plaquenil 200 bid , Motrin 80 tid , prednisone 10 q am , Dilantin\n400 q am , L-thyroxine 0.2 q day , folate 1 mg po q day , iron sulfate\n225 tid , Diprosone Ointment bid. She does not smoke or drink.\nFAMILY HISTORY is negative for collagen vascular diseases. She is\nthe mother of 5 children.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was an obese Hispanic female in mild\ndistress. Temperature was 99 , pulse 60 ,\nblood pressure 130/70 , respirations 18 , pulsus paradoxus of 10.\nSkin showed numerous discoid lesions of the scalp , face and right\nforearm and lower extremities with patchy alopecia. Head , eyes ,\nears , nose and throat examination was unremarkable. Neck was\nsupple , no adenopathy noted. Chest was clear. Cardiac examination\nshowed regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , with a I/VI systolic\nejection murmur at the left lower sternal border , otherwise no rubs\nor gallops. Back showed no costovertebral angle or spinal\ntenderness. Abdominal examination was benign , liver is 10 cm , and\nthe spleen tip is not palpable. Rectal examination was guaiac\nnegative , soft brown stools. She does have external hemorrhoids.\nExtremities were negative without cords or Homan's sign. Neurologic\nexamination was grossly intact , with normal cranial nerve function ,\nmotor , sensory , coordination and deep tendon reflexes , except for\nquestion of slight slowing of the relaxation phase of the reflexes\nin the upper and lower extremities. Musculoskeletal examination\nshowed diffuse bilateral asymmetric synovial thickening with\nslightly decreased range of motion most notably in the right elbow ,\nright metacarpophalangeal joint , left carpal , bilateral knees and\nankles.\nLABORATORY EXAMINATION: Electrolytes were all within normal\nlimits. Her CK was 76. Dilantin level\n5.6. White count was 4.7 , hematocrit 30 , platelets 352 , 000 , mean\ncorpuscular volume 83 , ESR 88 , oxygen saturation 99% on room air.\nUrinalysis showed specific gravity 1.026 , 2+ protein , 10 to 15\nwhite cells , 8 to 10 red blood cells and a few granular casts.\nChest x-ray showed increased heart size , otherwise negative , no\nchange from 15 of January .  She does have multiple thoracic compression\nfractures and osteopenia. The electrocardiogram showed sinus\nrhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions at a rate\nof approximately 70 , positive 45 degree axis , normal intervals ,\nT-wave inversion in III and V2 through V3 without changes in the PR\nor ST segments compared with 15 of January , and no decrease in the\nvoltages.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: Problem #1 was substernal chest pain. This\nseemed to be a pericardial pain secondary to\ndiscontinuation of her prednisone and Plaquenil as it happened\nnumerous times in the past. She was ruled out for a myocardial\ninfarction. She had an echocardiogram which showed a small amount\nof pericardial fluid without evidence of right ventricular\nindentation or compromise. She was placed back on her Plaquenil\n200 bid , and prednisone 30 q day and did well in that regard.\nProblem #2 was decreased hematocrit. This was felt to be probably\nsecondary to hydration as the hematocrit on hospital day #2 went\nfrom 31 to 27 with several liters of intravenous fluid. Stool\nguaiacs were negative throughout the hospitalization. The\nhematocrit remained stable between 27 and 30 without transfusions\nor further intervention. She did have a Coombs test sent which was\nmildly positive , although her hematocrit was stable. She was\ndischarged on folate and iron. Problem #3 is hematuria and pyuria\nat the time of admission. Urine culture and urine gram stain were\nboth negative for infection and this was followed up with a 24-hour\nurine collection for protein to assess for potential lupus\ninvolvement of the kidney , and this will need to be followed up on.\nDISPOSITION: The patient was discharged for FOLLOW-UP in\nRheumatology Clinic with Dr. Grondin . MEDICATIONS\nON DISCHARGE included Plaquenil 200 bid , prednisone 20 q day ,\nDilantin 400 q day , L-thyroxine 0.2 q am , Motrin 800 tid , Carafate ,\niron and folate.\n________________________________ PC935/9478\nDARRELL PITCAVAGE , M.D. NJ8 D: 9/23/90\nBatch: 5309 Report: Q6251C81 T: 10/14/90\nDictated By: JOESPH ZUEHL , M.D.\n[report_end]\n",
