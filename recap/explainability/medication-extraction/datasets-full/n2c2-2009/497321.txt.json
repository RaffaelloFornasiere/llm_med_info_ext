TPN was d/c'ed on the day of\ndischarge.\nACTIVITY: He may walk as tolerated.\nADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Incarcerated chronic ventral hernia status\npost sigmoid colectomy , colostomy , and Hartmann's operation.\nThe patient is to follow up with Dr. Galla in two weeks and\nDr. Caracciolo who is the attending in two weeks. He should also follow up with Dr.\nSmutzler , cardiology in 2 months , and Dr. Parramore , GI in 2-4 weeks.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 72-year-old male admitted for an\nincarcerated chronic ventral hernia , postoperative day 6 , status\npost sigmoid colectomy , colostomy , and Hartmann's operation.\nHospital course was complicated by postoperative acute\nrespiratory failure , respiratory acidosis with metabolic\nacidosis , pleural effusion , hypokalemia , myocardial infarction ,\nthrombocytopenia , and delirium. He has a known history of penile\ncancer status post penectomy complicated by perineal\nurethrocutaneous fistula , chronic anemia requiring transfusions ,\nnon-insulin-dependant diabetes , hypertension ,\nhypercholesterolemia , obesity , and recurrent UTIs. The patient\nhad a suprapubic catheter placed by Urology. His postoperative\ncourse otherwise was alright. He started having atrial\nfibrillation on 10/30/07 , initially remained stable with normal\nblood pressures. He was transferred to the floor on 10/30/07 ,\nwherein he developed rapid ventricular response to 120. On\n11/21/07 , he began hypotensive with systolics of 70. Cardiology\nwas consulted. He was initially treated with Lopressor and\ndiltiazem drip. He remained hypotensive despite IV boluses. He\nwas switched to amiodarone mode and drip , but again he became\nhypotensive. Therefore he was transferred to the unit and given\na digoxin load and was transferred for a possible\nelectrocardioversion. He remained asymptomatic throughout the\nday with low blood pressures. In the ICU , he was again started\nand maintained on amiodarone IV. He tolerated it without a\nproblem. He did have an episode of bright red blood from his NG\ntube in the ICU and GI was consulted. They felt given that his\nhematocrits have stabilized after two units of packed cells , he\ndid not need to be urgently scoped. He was started on Pepcid IV\nand a Nexium drip , and had hematocrit measured q.6 h. , which\nremains normal. He was transferred back to the floor on these\nmedications and was started on TPN after a PICC line was placed\nand continued to do well. He was scoped by GI on 6/20/07 , which\nshowed diffuse gastritis thought to be due to the NG tube , and\ntwo ulcers turned out bleeding. Postprocedure , he was started on\nCarafate and was transferred to Nexium p.o. after he was taking a\ndiet. Again , his PICC line was safe on 11/8/07 and he was\nstarted on TPN on 8/25/07 .  The NG tube was removed on 6/20/07\nand his diet has been slowly advanced. He is being discharged on\nTPN as his total caloric needs are still not being met by p.o.\nnutrition and he is in good condition on discharge.\nHe was not anti-coagulated for his Atrial Fibrillation due to his risk of GI\nbleeding , as decided by GI.\neScription document: 5-6745409 CSSten Tel\nDictated By: VOCK , RODOLFO\nAttending: REGINALDO , EARLE CHANCE\nDictation ID 6112785\nD: 8/26/07\nT: 8/26/07\n[report_end]\n", "annotations": [{"medication_name": "tylenol", "medication_dosage": "325 to 650 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.4 h. p.r.n.", "line": "8"}, {"medication_name": "duoneb", "medication_dosage": "3/0.5 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "q.6 h. p.r.n.", "line": "9"}, {"medication_name": "amiodarone", "medication_dosage": "400 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "daily", "line": "9"}, {"medication_name": "amiodarone", "medication_dosage": "400 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "b.i.d.", "line": "9"}, {"medication_name": "econazole nitrate", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "topical", "frequency": "daily", "line": "11"}, {"medication_name": "heparin", "medication_dosage": "5000 units", "mode": "subcutaneously", "frequency": "q.12 h.", "line": "12"}, {"medication_name": "regular insulin", "medication_dosage": "sliding scale", "mode": "subcutaneously", "frequency": "q.6 h.", "line": "13"}, {"medication_name": "imodium a-d", "medication_dosage": "2 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "b.i.d.", "line": "13"}, {"medication_name": "lopressor", "medication_dosage": "50 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.6 h.", "line": "14"}, {"medication_name": "metoclopramide", "medication_dosage": "10 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.i.d.", "line": "14"}, {"medication_name": "oxycodone 1 mg per 1 ml solution", "medication_dosage": "5 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.4 h. p.r.n.", "line": "16"}, {"medication_name": "omeprazole", "medication_dosage": "40 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "b.i.d.", "line": "16"}, {"medication_name": "carafate", "medication_dosage": "1 gm", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.i.d.", "line": "17"}, {"medication_name": "ambien", "medication_dosage": "2.5 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "nightly.", "line": "18"}, {"medication_name": "tpn", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "19"}, {"medication_name": "lopressor", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "44"}, {"medication_name": "diltiazem", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "drip.", "frequency": "", "line": "45"}, {"medication_name": "amiodarone", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "drip", "frequency": "", "line": "46"}, {"medication_name": "digoxin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "48"}, {"medication_name": "amiodarone", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "iv.", "frequency": "", "line": "51"}, {"medication_name": "packed cells", "medication_dosage": "two units", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "54"}, {"medication_name": "pepcid", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "iv", "frequency": "", "line": "55"}, {"medication_name": "nexium", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "drip", "frequency": "", "line": "56"}, {"medication_name": "these medications", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "57"}, {"medication_name": "tpn", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "58"}, {"medication_name": "nexium", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "", "line": "62"}, {"medication_name": "carafate", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "62"}, {"medication_name": "tpn", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "64"}, {"medication_name": "tpn", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "66"}]}
