She treated this at home with sublingual nitroglycerin with\npartial relief of her pain. She presented to the emergency room\nand had full resolution of her jaw pain with three sublingual\nnitroglycerin. Of note , when the patient presented with a non-ST\nelevation MI approximately three months prior , she also had left\njaw pain. Since this pain was the patient's classic anginal pain ,\nheparin was started despite the fact that she had negative cardiac\nenzymes and no EKG changes.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,\nhypertension , hyperlipidemia , coronary\nartery disease status post left circumflex stent in May 2002.\nAnxiety , depression , left arm phlebitis associated with blood draws\nafter her left circumflex stent was placed. Status post\nappendectomy , status post tubal ligation.\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\nMEDICATIONS: Glucophage , Lipitor , atenolol , aspirin , sublingual\nnitroglycerin p.r.n. , Zestril , Celexa , Klonopin ,\nNeurontin.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a daughter who works for Erdar Y University Hospitals She does not smoke nor does she drink\nalcohol. Her primary language is Spanish.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Positive for coronary artery disease. The\npatient's father died of a myocardial infarction\nat age 62 and her mother died of a myocardial infarction at age 75.\nVITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 100-137/52-67 , pulse 60-62 ,\nrespiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 97-98% on two\nliters nasal cannula.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Well appearing middle-aged female.\nNECK: JVP flat. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular\nrate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2. CHEST: Clear to\nauscultation bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended.\nPositive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: No lower extremity edema ,\nwarm. RECTAL: The patient is guaiac negative.\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: 1. Cardiovascular. The patient was\ntaken for cardiac catheterization\nafter she was admitted. Her cardiac catheterization was on\nMay , 2003. Prior to her catheterization she was enrolled in\nthe Nacan Cajord General Hospital This was a blinded trial with Permsan Madiston Ni Hospital inhibitor. In accordance with the trial , the patient was\nstarted on Lovenox 1 mg per kg subcutaneously b.i.d. Later that\nafternoon on May , 2003 , she went for cardiac catheterization.\nThe cath revealed a right dominant system with no significant left\nmain lesions , no significant left anterior descending lesions , 70%\ndiffuse lesion in the left circumflex artery consistent with\ninstant restenosis of her previously placed PIXEL stent. The right\ncoronary artery showed a 30% lesion. During this catheterization ,\nbrachytherapy to the vessel that showed instant restenosis was\nattempted , however , it was aborted due to technical malfunction of\nthe brachytherapy delivery machine. The lesion was , however ,\ndilated by balloon angioplasty. After dilatation there was TIMI-3\nflow with 10% residual stenosis.\nPostcath the patient did well. She was maintained on aspirin ,\nZocor , Lopressor , captopril , Celexa , Klonopin which are her home\nmedications. The morning after catheterization , the patient had\nrecurrent chest pain which radiated to her right jaw. The pain was\nrelieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. The following day , the\npatient did well. However , she began to develop a right groin\nhematoma in the afternoon on August , 2003. The hematoma was\nthought to be rapidly enlarging. Hematocrit checked at that time\nrevealed a significant drop in blood count to 26. The patient was\ntransfused two units of packed red blood cells. Her hematoma\ncontinue to expand overnight. The patient was discontinued from\nLovenox at that time. However , she was continued on aspirin and\nPlavix. The patient's Lovenox was reversed with protamine.\nOver the night , the patient's hematoma continued to expand. She\nreceived , the following morning on January , 2003 , one unit of\nfresh frozen plasma as well as a third unit of packed red blood\ncells. At that point , her hematoma was marked and it was noted to\nbe stable from that point on , no longer expanding beyond the bounds\nof the marks. Her left arm was noted at that time to also be tense\nwith hematoma secondary to blood draws. Vascular surgery was\nconsulted in the morning on January , 2003 , in order to assess the\nright groin hematoma as well as the hematoma in the left arm due to\nconcern for developing compartment syndrome. Vascular surgery saw\nthe patient and felt that as long as the patient's hematocrit\nstabilized , she would not need any surgical intervention. They\ncould not find any evidence for left upper extremity compartment\nsyndrome at that time.\nAlso on the morning of January , 2003 , the patient's platelets\nagents including both Plavix and aspirin were discontinued.\nFurther family history was obtained from the patient that day which\nrevealed history suspicious for possible bleeding disorder\nincluding the information that the patient's daughter bleeds\nheavily with each menstrual period , and that both the patient and\nher daughter have very easy bruising with history of several\nhematomas secondary to light trauma. The patient also reported\nthat she had heavy bleeding with childbirth that required extra\nhospitalization although it did not require a transfusion.\nHematology was consulted at that point. The patient was thought by\nhematology to have these hematomas secondary to over\nanticoagulation with Lovenox , Plavix , aspirin and possible STONDE MEDICAL CENTER\ntrial drug with a Kenda Medical Center The only familial\ncoagulation problems that were screened for based on their\nrecommendations were von Willebrand screen as well as a Factor XIII\nscreen. The Factor XIII screen eventually turned out normal and\nthe von Willebrand screen was pending at the time of discharge.\nBy the morning of November , 2003 , the patient had received a total\nof five units of packed red blood cells due to blood loss secondary\nto this hematoma. Her hematoma had stabilized at that time. She\nwas restarted on aspirin on November , 2003. From that point\nonward , the patient did quite well and was maintained on aspirin ,\nbeta-blocker , Zocor and ACE inhibitor.\nThe remainder of her hospitalization was uncomplicated and after\nthe patient had a stable hematocrit for several days without any\nrecurrent jaw pain , she was discharged home on March , 2003.\nNeurology. On November , 2003 , the patient developed a headache\nwhich she described as the same as she frequently experiences at\nhome. Her headaches are usually not responsive to Tylenol or other\nanalgesics. Given the patient's complications with hematoma and\nbleeding , a head CT was obtained that afternoon to rule out\nintracerebral hemorrhage. Her head CT was negative for bleeding.\nHer headache was treated with Tylenol to which it did not respond\nand later with Percocet to which she got some relief.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q day , Klonopin 0.5 mg\nt.i.d. , glucophage 500 mg b.i.d. , Celexa\n40 mg p.o. q.d. , Zestril 2.5 mg q.d. , atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d. ,\nLipitor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.\nFOLLOW UP: The patient was instructed to follow up with her\nprimary care physician , Dr. Bazer\nDictated By: LUKE DRENTLAW , M.D. HJ37\nAttending: MARK WILKES , M.D. AL98\nDZ035/427488\nBatch: 50332 Index No. QDDY4I6635 D:
