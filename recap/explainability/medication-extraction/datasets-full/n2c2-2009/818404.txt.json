FAT EMBOLI SYNDROME.\n2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.\n3. DECUBITUS ULCERS.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Lumadue is a 68-year-old man who\ncame in with a chief complaint of hip\npain after a mechanical fall. The patient had been hospitalized in\n3/0 for ischemic right toes requiring debridement and amputation.\nAt that time , his hospital course was complicated by a non-Q wave\nMI. Cardiology have recommended medical management with Lopressor\nat that time and an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of\n45%. Dobutamine MIBI revealed a severe fixed perfusion defect in\nthe inferoposterior and inferoseptal left ventricle without any\nperi-infarct ischemia. Ejection fraction by MIBI imaging was 26%\nin contrast to the echo results. The patient was ultimately\ndischarged on Lopressor , however , she stopped taking the Lopressor\nfor unclear reasons. For the few months prior to admission , he\ndeveloped increasing dyspnea on exertion with paroxysmal nocturnal\ndyspnea and increasing pedal edema , as well as nocturia , however ,\ndenied any orthopnea , any chest pain , fevers , melena , bright red\nblood per rectum or palpitations. A few days prior to admission ,\nthe patient developed a dry cough and some rhinorrhea.\nOn the morning of admission , the patient sustained a mechanical\nfall while trying to retrieve a newspaper. He had no\nlight-headedness , palpitations , pain in his chest , nausea or\nvomiting , sweating or change in vision or sensory symptoms prior to\nor after the fall. The patient fell onto his left side and\nimmediately developed left-sided leg and hip pain for which she\npresented to the emergency room at Fentstraub Neycian's Medical Center .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , cardiomyopathy\n( ischemic ) , peripheral vascular disease , \nstatus post amputation of right-sided toes , status post right\nfemoral to PT avascularization , diabetes type II , status post CVA , \nhypertension.\nMEDICATIONS: HCTZ 50 mg p.o. q.d. , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg\np.o. q.d. , Zestril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , glyburide 5 mg\np.o. q.d. , multivitamins , cough medicine p.r.n.\nALLERGIES: Aminoglycosides , unknown reaction.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of smoking one pack per\nday x40 years , quit five years prior to admission.\nHe has one drink of liquor per day , lives at home alone in Targtine Highway , Birm , Vermont 21711 , and is in the insurance business.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Notable for mother died of cancer at 74. Father\ndied at 55 of heart disease. Mother died at 50 of\na heart attack.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Afebrile , temperature 97.3 , \nheart rate 106 , blood pressure 162/77 , \noxygenation 94% on room air. GENERAL: He was alert and oriented.\nLUNGS: Clear. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. PELVIS: Stable.\nHis left lower extremity had well-healed scars from donor site for\nbypass grafting , strong dopplerable PT and DP pulses. His left leg\nwas externally rotated. Sensation was intact to light touch.\nLABORATORY DATA: Sodium 135 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 102 , bicarb\n19 , BUN 56 , creatinine 2.5. White count 12 , \nhematocrit 33 , platelets 388. PTT 40.5 , INR 1.2. EKG showed sinus\ntach at 102 , with occasional PVCs , normal axis , normal intervals , \nno evidence of ischemia. Chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary\nedema. X-rays of his left pelvis and femur revealed fracture of\nthe left intertrochanter and subtrochanteric fracture with lesser\ntrochanteric fracture intact by 3 cm , less than five degrees\nangulation. His femoral head was reduced.\nIMPRESSION: A 68-year-old man with significant cardiac history\nand vascular disease , status post left hip fracture\nwith mechanical fall , with pulmonary edema noted on chest x-ray.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular - Initially , the patient was\nto be admitted to the orthopedic service with\nmedicine consult for wrist stratification. However , the patient\nwas transferred to the medicine service for further evaluation and\nmanagement. The patient was noted to have a troponin leak although\nCK enzymes remained negative for ischemia. He had a MIBI performed\nwhich revealed an unchanged fixed defect. He remained in sinus\ntach with occasional PVCs and runs of nonsustained ventricular\ntachycardia lasting 3-4 beats at a time throughout his admission.\nSinus tach was attributed pain and discomfort , possibly with\nelement of hypoxia contributing as well. A troponin leak was\nattributed to strain particularly in the setting of his\ntachycardia. He was started on beta blocker , Ace inhibitor and\ncontinued on an aspirin. He was aggressively diuresed with\nafterload reduction. He was titrated upward as noted.\n2. Pulmonary - The patient's crackles persisted on lung exam after\naggressive diuresis , prompting performance of a chest CT which\nrevealed an interstitial pattern with peripheral nodularity\nconsistent with fat emboli syndrome , positive component of\ncongestive heart failure and aspiration pneumonia as well. The\npatient was continued on a regimen of Lasix for diuresis and was\ntreated for aspiration pneumonia as noted below. His oxygen\nrequirement diminished over a few days and he was maintained on two\nliters of nasal cannula oxygen at the time of transfer to rehab.\n3. Renal - The patient developed some renal failure in the setting\nof diuresis , which improved with hydration. The patient\nsubsequently tolerated further diuresis with improvement in his\ncreatinine and it is possible that renal failure is due to fat\nemboli syndrome as well and should improve slowly.\n4. ID - The patient was treated with vancomycin , Flagyl and\nlevofloxacin for presumed aspiration pneumonia , course completed\n5/6/02. The patient remained afebrile. His white blood count on\nadmission and discharge was 12.\n5. Neurologically - The patient apparently had baseline mild\nperfusion. The possibly worsened due to the fat embolic syndrome\nand was at baseline prior to discharge per the patient's daughter.\n6. Heme - The patient was continued on Lovenox 60 mg subcu. b.i.d.\nfor prophylaxis against DVT post-hip surgery to continue for six\nmonths minimal followed by orthopedic surgery.\n7. GI - The patient developed some diarrhea. C. diff. cultures\nwere negative to date at the time of discharge. The patient was\nmaintained on Nexium prophylaxis in the setting of his\nanticoagulation.\n8. Endocrine - The patient was restarted on oral hypoglycemics\nprior to discharge in addition to sliding scale insulin. The\npatient had a Foley and a triple lumen catheter , both of which were\nremoved on 5/6/02. The patient was evaluated by plastic surgery\nfor his peripheral vascular disease with ulcers. Recommended dry\nsterile dressings to the right and left foot wound changed q.d.\nwith DuoDerm to the left lower leg wound to be changed q.3 days ,\nwith pressure sore prevention.\n9. FEN - The patient was discharged on standing 20 mEq of K-Dur\nq.d. It is likely to be checked q.o.d. to monitor for any further\nrequirements particularly in the setting of his runs of\nnonsustained V-tach as noted above.\n10. Ortho - The patient is followed daily by orthopedic surgery\nand was discharged with staples on his left lower extremities to be\ndiscontinued per orthopedic surgery recommendations in the future.\n11. Disposition - The patient was stable for discharge to rehab on\n8/18/02. He was to follow up with his primary care physician ,\northopedic surgery , cardiology , and pulmonary medicine within the\nnext two weeks. His labs are to be drawn for a metabolic panel ,\nmagnesium and calcium q.o.d. for as long as the primary care\nphysician feels it is necessary with repletion of his electrolytes\nas needed. He is to have physical therapy performed as needed.\nHis weightbearing status is non-weightbearing on the left lower\nextremity and weightbearing as tolerated on his right lower\nextremity per orthopedic surgery at the time of discharge.\nDISCHARGE DIET: ADA diet , low fat , low cholesterol , low salt.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,\nLopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , hold for\nsystolic blood pressure less than 100 or heart rate less than 55 ,\nlisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d. , hold for systolic blood pressure less\nthan 100 , Lasix 100 mg p.o. q.d. , Lovenox 60 mg subcu. b.i.d. x6\nmonths , glipizide 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. , sliding scale insulin , Nexium\n20 mg p.o. q.d. , Silvadene wet-to-dry dressing , please appy dry\nsterile dressing to right and left foot wound to change q.d. Apply\nDuoDerm to left lower leg wound and change q.3 days , continue\npressure care precautions.\nDictated By: EVAN HOBLIT , M.D. XJ782\nAttending: ENOCH HADDAWAY , M.D. FV88\nSJ564/025538\nBatch: 3727 Index No. WICEEC84U0 D: 6/12/02\nT: 6/12/02\n[report_end]\n", "annotations": [{"medication_name": "lopressor", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "13"}, {"medication_name": "dobutamine", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "15"}, {"medication_name": "lopressor", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "19"}, {"medication_name": "hctz", "medication_dosage": "50 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.d.", "line": "38"}, {"medication_name": "enteric-coated aspirin", "medication_dosage": "325 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.d.", "line": "38"}, {"medication_name": "zestril", "medication_dosage": "20 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.d.", "line": "39"}, {"medication_name": "glyburide", "medication_dosage": "5 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.d.", "line": "39"}, {"medication_name": "cough medicine", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "p.r.n.", "line": "40"}, {"medication_name": "multivitamins", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "40"}, {"medication_name": "beta blocker", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "79"}, {"medication_name": "ace inhibitor", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "79"}, {"medication_name": "aspirin.", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "80"}, {"medication_name": "lasix", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "87"}, {"medication_name": "oxygen", "medication_dosage": "two liters", "mode": "nasal cannula", "frequency": "", "line": "90"}, {"medication_name": "vancomycin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "96"}, {"medication_name": "flagyl", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "96"}, {"medication_name": "levofloxacin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "97"}, {"medication_name": "lovenox", "medication_dosage": "60 mg", "mode": "subcu.", "frequency": "b.i.d.", "line": "103"}, {"medication_name": "nexium", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "108"}, {"medication_name": "hypoglycemics", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "oral", "frequency": "", "line": "110"}, {"medication_name": "insulin.", "medication_dosage": "sliding scale", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "111"}, {"medication_name": "k-dur", "medication_dosage": "20 meq", "mode": "", "frequency": "q.d.", "line": "118"}, {"medication_name": "enteric-coated aspirin", "medication_dosage": "325 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.d.", "line": "136"}, {"medication_name": "lopressor", "medication_dosage": "12.5 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "t.i.d.", "line": "137"}, {"medication_name": "lisinopril", "medication_dosage": "5 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.d.", "line": "139"}, {"medication_name": "lasix", "medication_dosage": "100 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.d.", "line": "140"}, {"medication_name": "lovenox", "medication_dosage": "60 mg", "mode": "subcu.", "frequency": "b.i.d.", "line": "140"}, {"medication_name": "nexium", "medication_dosage": "20 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.d.", "line": "141"}, {"medication_name": "glipizide", "medication_dosage": "2.5 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.d.", "line": "141"}, {"medication_name": "insulin", "medication_dosage": "sliding scale", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "141"}, {"medication_name": "silvadene", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "q.d.", "line": "142"}, {"medication_name": "duoderm", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "q.3 days", "line": "144"}]}
