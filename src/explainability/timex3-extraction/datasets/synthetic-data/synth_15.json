{"text": "**Patient Discharge Summary**\n\nPatient: Emily Roberts  \nAge: 55  \nAdmitted: September 8th, 2024  \nDischarged: 09/16/24  \n\nDear Dr. Smith,\n\nI am pleased to inform you of the discharge of Ms. Emily Roberts, a 55-year-old female who was admitted to our hospital on September 8th, 2024. Ms. Roberts presented with complaints of severe abdominal pain, jaundice, and pruritus.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, Ms. Roberts underwent a comprehensive hepatobiliary evaluation, including liver function tests, abdominal ultrasound, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). The findings revealed evidence of obstructive jaundice secondary to a common bile duct stone.\n\nOn September 10th, 2024, Ms. Roberts underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and stone extraction, successfully resolving the biliary obstruction. She tolerated the procedure well and showed improvement in her symptoms postoperatively.\n\nThroughout her hospital stay, Ms. Roberts received intravenous hydration, pain management, and supportive care to promote her recovery. She was closely monitored for signs of infection and biliary complications.\n\nAfter eight days of hospitalization, Ms. Roberts's jaundice resolved, and she was discharged home on September 16th, 2024. She was provided with a prescription for oral analgesics, dietary recommendations to prevent biliary colic, and instructions for follow-up with gastroenterology for surveillance ERCP.\n\nWe anticipate a smooth recovery for Ms. Roberts and recommend close outpatient follow-up to monitor her biliary health.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Physician's Signature]  \nDr. Sarah Smith  \nGastroenterologist  ", "annotations": [{"text": "September 8th, 2024", "date_value": "2024-09-08"}, {"text": "09/16/24", "date_value": "2024-09-16"}, {"text": "eight days", "date_value": "2024-09-16"}, {"text": "on September 16th, 2024", "date_value": "2024-09-16"}, {"text": "postoperatively", "date_value": "2024-09-16"}, {"text": "after eight days", "date_value": "2024-09-16"}]}
