The\npatient was found to be febrile with leukocytosis in the ED. The\npatient had been seen previously in the ED on 3/30/06 at which\ntime she was treated with a UTI. She was sent home with a\nseven-day course of ciprofloxacin and oxycodone for pain. The\nciprofloxacin was renally dosed. The patient reports that she\nstopped taking oxycodone and ciprofloxacin. After developing\nconstipation , it is unclear if she completed her full course of\nantibiotics. She currently present with complaints of diarrhea\nin the setting of having taken laxative at home. No melena or\nhematochezia. The pain is not related to food , urination , or\ndefecation. She has poor p.o. intake , denies any sick contacts\nat home. No recent travel.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nPositive for blood sugars ranging from 180-190 , although she had\na blood sugar of 499 on the morning of admission. She has\nfatigue but no myalgias , no cough , chest pain , shortness of\nbreath , no dysuria. In the ED , she was given ampicillin 2 g IV ,\ngentamicin 80 mg IV , Flagyl 500 mg IV and 8 units of insulin.\nALLERGIES:\nMedication reaction , she has an allergy to lisinopril with\nreaction of elevated creatinine at a low dose. To levofloxacin ,\nshe has reflux and celecoxib gives her dizziness and elevated\ncreatinine.\nBRIEF ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nShe had a temperature of 101 , pulse of 106 , blood pressure\n172/71 , oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She was alert and\noriented x3 , in mild distress. Her lungs were clear to\nauscultation bilaterally. Her heart had a regular rate and\nrhythm with a 2/6 early systolic murmur at the left lower sternal\nborder. She was obese , but had a nontender , nondistended abdomen\nwith normal abdominal bowel sounds. She was guaiac negative , and\nher left foot was in a cast.\nPERTINENT LABORATORY TESTS AND RESULTS:\nShe had a sodium of 127 , corrected to 131 with her glucose ,\npotassium of 4.9 , bicarbonate of 27 , BUN 95 , creatinine 4.5 ,\nglucose 329. LFTs were normal , amylase 19 , lipase 8 , negative\nketo acids in the serum and urine. Her white blood count was\n26.8 , INR was 1.4 , PTT was 36.6. She had a dirty urinalysis.\nShe had an abdominal CT that showed a non-incarcerated hernia , no\nevidence of colitis.\nOPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:\nThe patient had a debridement of her left foot on 3/11/06. She\nalso had hemodialysis initiated on 1/10/06.\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:\n1. Infectious disease: The patient's left foot was encasted by\northopedics surgery on 6/1/06 with evidence of underlying\ninfection. Her wound cultures grew MRSA with probes to the bone.\nX-rays were unrevealing and MRI showed severe osteomyelitis. In\naddition , the patient had an ESR of 109. The patient was thus\nput on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and Flagyl. Blood cultures from\n7/14/06 additionally grew gram-positive cocci in clusters which\neventually yielded MRSA. However , surveillance cultures with\ntreatment on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and Flagyl were negative.\nThe patient received debridement of her left foot on 3/11/06.\nIn the OR , the bone looked necrotic and infected. The bone was\nsent to pathology and microbiology , the results of which are\npending. Given the appearance of her bone during debridement , it\nis presumed that the patient will need eight weeks of vancomycin.\nBecause she did have a clear source of fevers after it was found\nthat she had osteomyelitis , the patient was discontinued off\nFlagyl and levofloxacin on 5/22/06.\n2. GI: The patient has abdominal pain with gastric emptying\nstudy on 7/14/06 showing 0% clearance at 90 minutes consistent\nwith severe gastroparesis versus obstruction. Radiology did not\nfeel that an upper GI series would give further information\nregarding obstruction and it was judged to be unlikely given that\nthe patient has bowel movements and rare emesis. Later on in the\nhospital course , the patient was put on erythromycin with a\ndecrease in her symptoms of abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting.\nThe patient did have any evidence of bowel ischemia on MRA.\nLater , erythromycin was changed to Reglan on 8/6/06 per renal\nrequest during hemodialysis. There is no evidence of pancreatis\nor liver disease and the patient was also kept on Compazine for\nnausea.\n3. Renal: The patient had , on admission , acute on chronic renal\nfailure. There was a concern for prerenal azotemia in the\nsetting of nausea and vomiting and diarrhea. She had a\nfractional excretion of sodium which was 0.3% , but it was\ndifficult to interpret in the setting of end-stage renal disease.\nLasix and Cozaar were held. However , the creatinine continued\nto worsen reaching 6.1 on 10/14/06. Renal was consulted\nregarding the need for dialysis. On admission , the patient did\nhave matured AV fistula graft and she was thus started on\nhemodialysis on 1/10/06.\n4. Hematology: The patient had an INR which was elevated.\nHematocrit was also decreased to 25.5 from 34. She was guaiac\nnegative and did have any schistocyte. Her LDH was also normal\nwith her haptoglobin high. It was judged from her iron studies\nthat the patient was iron deficient. She was put on iron\nsupplementation. She also was felt to have renal component to\nher anemia and she was started on darbepoetin initially and\nchanged to erythropoietin later during dialysis by renal.\n5. Cardiovascular: The patient was maintained on aspirin , a\nstatin , and calcium channel blocker. She started prophylactic\nbeta-blocker during her hospital course as well.\n6. Endocrine: The patient had hemoglobin A1c of 7.8. She was\ntransitioned to NPH and Aspart during her hospital stay. She had\nintermittent problems with hypoglycemia in the setting of being\nNPO pending operations and procedures; however , her insulin\nregimen was titrated to good glycemic response.\n7. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on heparin and Nexium.\n8. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: Her IV fluids were\nstopped as the patient was oliguric and anuric initially before\nhemodialysis. Later on , she was also put on 1500 mL fluid\nrestriction. Later on during dialysis , her volume status\nresolved euvolemia. She was kept on a low fat and low\ncholesterol diabetic diet. The patient is full code.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4. p.r.n. headache.\n2. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.\n3. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n4. Heparin 5000 units subq t.i.d.\n5.
