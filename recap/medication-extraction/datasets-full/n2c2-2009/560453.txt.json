Knee pain.\n2. Chronic venous stasis.\n3. Lithium toxicity.\n4. Obesity.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nThis is a 50-year-old female with a history of hypertension ,\ndiabetes , obesity , as well as a schizophrenia and bipolar\ndisorder , presents with right knee swelling , redness and pain for\none week. The patient lives alone at home and has two brothers\nwho periodically check in on her. She was visited by her brother\nyesterday and found that her right knee had been swollen red and\ntender for about a week. After he noted this , he brought her to\nthe emergency department. The patient states that the leg has\nmade it impossible for her to ambulate. She denies trauma to the\narea recently. She also denies fevers , chills , shortness of\nbreath or chest pain. There is no nausea , vomiting , constipation\nor diarrhea.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Ovarian cystadenofibroma , status post TAH-BSO in 1/24\n2. Obesity.\n3. Hypertension.\n4. Diabetes.\n5. Hyperlipidemia.\n6. Schizophrenia.\n7. Bipolar disorder.\n8. Obstructive sleep apnea , on home BiPAP.\n9. History of laparoscopy for infertility.\nALLERGIES:\nNo known drug allergies.\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\n1. Lisinopril 10 mg daily.\n2. Lipitor 40 mg daily.\n3. Klonopin.\n4. MetroGel p.o. at bedtime.\n5. Lithium 900 mg at bedtime.\n6. Acebutolol 200 mg daily.\n7. Risperdal 0.5 mg at bedtime.\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\nThe patient lives at home alone. She smokes tobacco , but denies\nethanol. She does drink several bottles of soda per day. Her\nbrother , Willard Kloock , did involve in her care; his phone number\nis 427-986-1973 , he can also be reached at 243-754-1828. Her\nother brother , Merrill Luersen , is also involved in her care and can\nbe reached at 938-506-7946.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nTemperature 97.5 , pulse 42 , blood pressure 107/58 , respirations\n20 , and oxygen saturation 97%. In general , this is an obese\nfemale , she is Spanish-speaking mostly. She appears unkempt and\nin discomfort somewhat because of her right knee pain. She is no\nacute distress. Cardiovascular exam shows bradycardia , with\nnormal S1 and S2 , and 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at\nthe left upper sternal border. Her chest exam showed some low\nsoft rumbling sounds with inspiration and expiration , otherwise ,\nclear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen was distended and\nobese. There are positive bowel sounds , and no palpable liver\nand spleen. Extremity exam showed uncut nails on upper and lower\nextremities bilaterally. Her right leg was greater in size than\nher left , however , both show significant 2-3+ pitting edema. On\nthe right ankle area , there appears to be chronic venous stasis\nchanges with hyperpigmented patch on the lower extremity. There\nare less chronic venous stasis changes on the left lower\nextremity. There was some mild erythema around the right knee.\nThis area of redness was poorly demarcated and mildly blanching.\nThere was painful passive motion on her right knee. Neuro exam\nwas grossly intact and nonfocal. She did have a coarse tremor in\nher upper and lower extremities when asked to use these\nextremities for motion.\nDIAGNOSTIC DATA:\nElectrolytes were significant for a potassium of 5.8 and a\ncreatinine of 1.6 that was raised from previous creatinine in\n2004 of 1.0. Her liver enzymes were unremarkable. Her\nhematocrit was 45.5. A UA done on admission was bland , however ,\nurine cultures grew greater than a 1000 CFU/mL of coag-negative\nStaphylococcus. Her right knee film showed mild effusion , no\nfracture. This effusion was tapped and showed 20 white blood\ncells , 810 red blood cells. Of the white blood cells , 21% were\nPMNs and 75% were lymphocytes. There were no crystals seen.\nThere were no organisms seen.\nASSESSMENT:\nMs. Fought is a 50-year-old female with a history of bipolar\ndisorder , schizophrenia , obstructive sleep apnea , hypertension ,\nand diabetes , was admitted for one week of worsening right knee\nredness , swelling and pain causing immobility.\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM/PROBLEM:\n1. Leg swelling: The differential diagnosis that was considered\nfor her leg swelling included deep venous thrombosis versus\ncellulitis versus septic joints versus gout versus chronic\nlymphedema with an acute worsening. Infectious causes were\nconsidered less likely given the fact that the patient's white\ncount was not significantly elevated , ( it was 10.5 with 75%\npolys , and 80% lymphs ) , and in fact that she has not had any\nfever. The patient was treated empirically , however , as this\ndiagnosis was unable to be ruled out initially with vancomycin\nand Unasyn and then with levofloxacin. The patient was treated\nwith therapeutic doses of heparin because of the concern of pain\nand swelling asymmetrically of the lower extremities. This\ncontinued until lower extremity Doppler studies showed no deep\nvenous thrombosis in the right femoral or left popliteal veins.\nUric acid levels were checked and shown to be elevated at 8.6 and\nagain at 8.0. These values suggest that gout may be involved in\nthis problem , however , there are no crystals and the synovial\nfluid making this diagnosis also less likely. Over her hospital\ncourse , the swelling , tenderness and redness of the right knee\ndecreased significantly. However , the patient's left knee began\nto cause her significant pain , requiring oxycodone , Tylenol and\nlidocaine patch. Because of concerning renal function with a\ncreatinine of 1.6 from 1.0 , NSAIDs were held initially , however ,\nher creatinine trended down to 1.2 on the day of discharge , and\nso she will be discharged with NSAIDs , which are expected to help\nher musculoskeletal pain. While in the hospital , she received\nPhysical Therapy who evaluated the patient and suggested that the\npatient would benefit from continued direct physical therapy to\naddress functional mobility retraining. Short-terms goals\nincluded ambulate 50 feet with minimal assistance with\nrestrictive device , and to tolerate out of bed to chair for 30\nminutes with reports of fatigue.\n2. Lithium toxicity: Because of the patient's coarse tremor ,\nbradycardia , hypotension , and the fact that she was taking\nlithium , encouraged her lithium level to be checked which came\nback elevated at 2.7 , ( normal levels between 0.5 and 1.3 ). This\nlevel was concerning because lithium has a very narrow\ntherapeutic window. Her lithium was held and she was treated\nwith IV fluids , which allowed her creatinine to decrease. It was\nthought that she was also somewhat dehydrated on presentation to\nthe emergency department. Her lithium toxicity could in part\nexplain for her bradycardia and hypotension as well as her\nhypokalemia and renal failure. A psych consult was obtained to\naddress the question of when and how to restart the lithium. The\npsych consultant suggested to check lithium levels daily until\nthey fell below 0.5 and then should restart the lithium at 300 mg\nat bedtime. On the day of discharge , her lithium level was at\n1.12. This level should be checked at the nursing facility and\nlithium should be restarted at 300 mg at bedtime when the level\nis 0.5 or below.\n3. Cardiovascular: From a pump standpoint , the patient was\nhypovolemic and hypotensive on presentation to the emergency\ndepartment. She responded well to normal saline fluid boluses\nand given a total of 3 liters over her hospital course. From a\nrhythm standpoint , the patient's bradycardia was resolved of\neither over beta blockade or lithium toxicity. Her beta-blocker\nwas held as well as her lithium and her heart rate improved to\nthe 50 and 60s. We would recommend holding the beta-blocker\nuntil follow up at her primary care physician's office for her\nnext appointment. From an ischemia standpoint , EKG was performed\nwhich was a poor study that showed perhaps some T-wave inversions\nin aVL. However , ACS is unlikely at this time. The patient had\nno chest pain.\n4. Renal: Acute renal failure on presentation with a creatinine\nof 1.6 and 1.0 is likely prerenal versus lithium toxicity versus\na combination of these. A creatinine improved to 1.2 on the day\nof discharge.\n5. Endocrinology: The patient had a history of diabetes\naccording to her medical records. Her glucose while admitted\nhere was in between 90 and 132. These were random glucose draws.\nHemoglobin A1c was checked which came back at 6.2. At this\ntime , diabetes may or may not be an appropriate diagnosis for her\nand she should follow up with her primary care physician with a\nfasting blood glucose test.\n6. Infectious disease: On initial presentation , the patient\npresented with hypotension in the setting of bradycardia and beta\nblockade with decreased volume status. There was a concern\ninitially that this may be cellulitis and she was covered broadly\nwith Unasyn and vancomycin. However , as she improved , and the\nredness and swelling decreased , she was switched to levofloxacin\nand committed to complete a seven-day course. She will complete\nsix more days after discharge from the hospital of levofloxacin.\n7. Deconditioning: As mentioned above , Physical Therapy was\nconsulted and the patient will go to nursing facility for a\ntemporary rehabilitation. Upon discharge to her home from rehab ,\nhome safety evaluation should take place to make sure that the\npatient is okay to go back home and can give the services that\nshe needs.\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\n1. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain.\n2. Klonopin 1 mg p.o. at bedtime.\n3. Oxycodone 5 mg to 10 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain , please hold\nif respiration rate is less than 12.\n4. Risperdal 0.5 mg p.o. at bedtime.\n5. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. daily for six days after the day of\ndischarge from Wilgeimante Eycis Health on 0/19/05.\n6. Ibuprofen 600 mg q.6h. p.r.n. pain.\nDISCHARGE DISPOSITION:\nThe patient was discharged in stable condition to a nursing\nfacility. Please draw blood for lithium level checks daily until\nit is below 0.5 , at which time , she should be restarted on\nlithium 300 mg p.o. at bedtime. She will follow up with her\nprimary care physician , Dr. Aurelio Gilberto Hencheck at Li County Hospital , phone number is 156-903-7650. A message\nwas left in the voice mail of her physician's office to schedule\nher an appointment and to contact her brother , Oren Dad , at\nphone number 427-986-1973 or 683-173-8613 , or Daren Perella at\n990-786-9092 to inform them at when the appointment will be. It\nwas requested that she be seen within two to three weeks.\neScription document: 3-9332178 EMSSten Tel\nCC: Colby Kopan M.D.\nComho Street , Sas Co Lareox , Utah 34863\nAna\nCC: Raul Nagelschmidt MD\nLem Ca Chi\nSon Oak\nDictated By: BEKER , ANIBAL\nAttending: BEIL , LYMAN\nDictation ID 1150769\nD: 6/17/05\nT: 6/17/05\n[report_end]\n", "annotations": [{"medication_name": "lisinopril", "medication_dosage": "10 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "daily", "line": "36"}, {"medication_name": "lipitor", "medication_dosage": "40 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "daily", "line": "37"}, {"medication_name": "klonopin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "38"}, {"medication_name": "metrogel", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "at bedtime", "line": "39"}, {"medication_name": "lithium", "medication_dosage": "900 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "at bedtime", "line": "40"}, {"medication_name": "acebutolol", "medication_dosage": "200 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "daily", "line": "41"}, {"medication_name": "risperdal", "medication_dosage": "0.5 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "at bedtime", "line": "42"}, {"medication_name": "vancomycin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "98"}, {"medication_name": "levofloxacin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "99"}, {"medication_name": "unasyn", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "99"}, {"medication_name": "heparin", "medication_dosage": "therapeutic doses", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "100"}, {"medication_name": "oxycodone", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "110"}, {"medication_name": "tylenol", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "110"}, {"medication_name": "lidocaine patch", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "111"}, {"medication_name": "nsaids", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "112"}, {"medication_name": "nsaids", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "114"}, {"medication_name": "lithium", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "124"}, {"medication_name": "lithium", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "127"}, {"medication_name": "fluids", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "iv", "frequency": "", "line": "128"}, {"medication_name": "lithium.", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "133"}, {"medication_name": "lithium", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "134"}, {"medication_name": "lithium", "medication_dosage": "300 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "at bedtime.", "line": "135"}, {"medication_name": "lithium", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "136"}, {"medication_name": "lithium", "medication_dosage": "300 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "at bedtime", "line": "138"}, {"medication_name": "normal saline fluid boluses", "medication_dosage": "3 liters", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "142"}, {"medication_name": "beta-blocker", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "145"}, {"medication_name": "beta blockade", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "145"}, {"medication_name": "lithium", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "146"}, {"medication_name": "beta-blocker", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "147"}, {"medication_name": "beta blockade", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "165"}, {"medication_name": "vancomycin.", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "168"}, {"medication_name": "unasyn", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "168"}, {"medication_name": "levofloxacin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "169"}, {"medication_name": "levofloxacin.", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "171"}, {"medication_name": "tylenol", "medication_dosage": "650 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.4h. p.r.n.", "line": "179"}, {"medication_name": "klonopin", "medication_dosage": "1 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "at bedtime", "line": "180"}, {"medication_name": "oxycodone", "medication_dosage": "5 mg to 10 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.4h. p.r.n.", "line": "181"}, {"medication_name": "risperdal", "medication_dosage": "0.5 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "at bedtime", "line": "183"}, {"medication_name": "levofloxacin", "medication_dosage": "500 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "daily", "line": "184"}, {"medication_name": "ibuprofen", "medication_dosage": "600 mg", "mode": "", "frequency": "q.6h. p.r.n.", "line": "186"}, {"medication_name": "lithium", "medication_dosage": "300 mg", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "at bedtime", "line": "191"}]}
