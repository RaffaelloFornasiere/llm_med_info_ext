During the\nprevious admission , she had been diuresed with a Lasix drip and\nthen started on amiodarone and Coumadin for a new paroxysmal\natrial fibrillation. After discharge , she presented to NSCHC\nCardiology Clinic on 9/28/2006 with a jugular venous pressure at\n15 cm and severe bilateral lower extremity edema and a BNP of\n2500. The assessment in clinic was that she had been under\ndiuresed in the previous admission and therefore she was directly\nadmitted to Poredtiesbarre General Hospital for reinitiation of aggressive\ndiuresis. Of note , the patient had recently changed from Lasix\nto torsemide after the last discharge as her outpatient\nmedication. She endorsed worsened orthopnea , dyspnea on\nexertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as well as early satiety.\nShe denied any chest pain or other anginal equivalents.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30%-35%.\n2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , newly on Coumadin and\namiodarone.\n3. Coronary artery disease status post MI.\n4.

Anemia.\n11. Obesity.\n12. Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of\n2.9 followed by SVMC Renal Clinic.\nMEDICATIONS AT HOME:\n1. Torsemide 100 mg q.a.m. and 50 mg q.p.m.\n2. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. anxiety.\n3. Folate 1 mg p.o. daily.\n4. Lipitor 80 mg p.o. at bedtime.\n5. Lantus 18 units subcutaneously nightly\n6. Coumadin 1 mg q.p.m.\n7. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n8. Procrit 40 , 000 units subcutaneously every other week.\n9. Nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n. chest pain.\n10. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.\n11. Vitamin B12 subcutaneous injections at clinic.\n12. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.\n13. Iron 325 mg p.o. t.i.d.\n14. Metolazone p.r.n.\nALLERGIES: Lisinopril and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives at home with\nher husband. She quit tobacco with rare alcohol use and no\ndrugs.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory. There is no family history of\ncardiac disease.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature was 98.9 , heart\nrate 70 , blood pressure 104/50 , respiratory rate of 20 , oxygen\nsaturation 95% on room air. In general , the patient was\ncomfortable in no acute distress. HEENT , Pupils were equal ,\nround , and reactive. Oropharynx was clear. The JVP was greater\nthan 15 cm , chest exam showed bilateral crackles at the bases\nwith bibasilar dullness well as well as right greater than left\nbase. Cardiovascular was regular rate and rhythm with a S3 and\nno murmur. Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended with a\nnonpulsatile liver. Extremities showed 3+ pitting edema\nbilaterally to the hips with bilateral changes of arterial and\nvenous insufficiency. Laboratory studies were significant for an\nINR of 1.6 , BUN of 110 , creatinine 3 , white blood cell count of\n11.7 and a hematocrit of 27.9.\nEKG on admission was a normal sinus rhythm with evidence of a\nprevious anterior MI with lateral repolarization , ST and T wave\nabnormalities , and possible LVH.\nChest x-ray showed bilateral effusions , left greater than right\nwith increased vascular markings and fluid in the right fissure ,\nbut no discrete infiltrates.\nIMPRESSION: This is a 70-year-old woman with ischemic\ncardiomyopathy with an EF of 35% , coronary artery disease status\npost MI , insulin-dependent diabetes , peripheral vascular disease ,\nchronic renal insufficiency who presented in volume overload\nafter a recent admission with insufficient diuresis.\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:\n1. Cardiovascular. In terms of pump , the patient was clearly in\ngross volume overload from both the right sided and left-sided\nfailure on presentation. Her blood pressure was stable and she\nhad no evidence of severely decreased cardiac output or/and organ\nperfusion. She was started on the Lasix drip at 10 mg per hour\nand Zaroxolyn at 2.5 mg p.o. daily. Her Lopressor was held for a\ndecompensated heart failure. She initially diuresed well\novernight; however , on the second day her diuresis tapered off\nand her Lasix drip was turned up to 20 mg per hour and the\nZaroxolyn was increased to b.i.d. She met her I&amp;O goal of\ngreater than 1 liter negative overnight the following night ,\nhowever , a day later , she again had poor diuresis and the\nZaroxolyn was changed to Diuril. At this time , a repeat chest\nx-ray showed a very little change in her bilateral pleural\neffusions , so her diuresis up to this point was felt to be\ninsufficient. After the transition from Zaroxolyn to Diuril ,\nwhich was given 250 mg IV b.i.d. , she was noted to have an\nincrease in creatinine from 2.9. gradually up to 3.2; however ,\nremained stable for the next few days and the patient was able to\nmaintain good diuresis on this regimen without bump in her\ncreatinine.\nOn 6/27/2006 , she was noted to have greatly improved lower\nextremity edema and that improved lung exam and she had met her\ngoal weight of less than 85 kilograms. Lasix drip was\ndiscontinued in the afternoon on 6/27/2006 and she was restarted\non her home p.o. torsemide regimen of 100 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 50\nmg p.o. q.p.m. for anticipated discharge home on 5/15/2006 .  The\nDiuril was also discontinued. The patient was anticipated to be\nstable on b.i.d. torsemide and p.o. on metolazone at home. Her\nnew dry weight on this admission was established at 85 kilograms\nand this should be at a goal for diuresis should she require\nadmission in the future.\nShe will follow up with her CSH cardiologist for further\nmonitoring of her volume status after discharge. In terms of\nrhythm , the patient had a new presentation of atrial fibrillation\non the prior admission and was started on amiodarone and Coumadin\nat that time. She was in normal sinus rhythm on presentation at\nthis admission and remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the\nadmission and was monitored on telemetry with no other events.\nShe was continued on her home dose of amiodarone and continued on\nCoumadin; however despite the dose being decreased from her home\ndose of 1 mg q.p.m. to a 0.5 mg q.p.m. , her INR continued to rise\nand was eventually 3.5. Her Coumadin was discontinued. She was\nrecommended to be discharged off Coumadin and follow up with her\nprimary care provider during the week following discharge to\nrecheck her INR and restart her Coumadin when it falls below 2.5.\nIn terms of ischemia , the patient had no acute evidence of\nischemia on presentation. Denied any chest pain and had no\nchanges consistent with ischemia on her EKG. She was continued\non aspirin and Lipitor throughout the admission.\n2. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency at\nbaseline. Her creatinine did increase from a baseline of 2.9 to\n3.2. During this admission , however , remained stable after that\npoint. She continued on renally-dosed medications and actually\nrequired repletion of both potassium and magnesium despite her\nrenal insufficiency throughout the admission in the setting of\naggressive diuresis. Her electrolytes were stable prior to\ndischarge home. She was followed by the LCH Renal Clinic with\nwhom she has had a previous conversations about the possibility\nof hemodialysis in the future and she will see them shortly after\nthis discharge:\n3. Pulmonary: The patient had dyspnea on exertion and bilateral\npleural effusions on her chest x-ray on admission. This was all\nfelt to be consistent with her heart failure. She did have no\nsigns or symptoms of any infectious etiology either on imaging or\nas a part of her clinical picture. Her dyspnea on exertion and\nher lung exam both improved with her aggressive diuresis.\n4. Endocrine: The patient had erratic fingersticks early in the\nadmission with a very low fingerstick blood glucoses in the\nmorning initially , so her p.m. Lantus dose was decreased from 18\nunits to 16 units and the NovoLog sliding scale was started.\nOn 0/12/2006 , she was noted to continue to have lower sugars in\nthe morning , but routinely elevated sugars in the afternoon\ngreater than 200. She was started on q.a.c. NovoLog regimen.\nHowever , on this regimen , she was found 1 morning to have a\nfingerstick blood glucose of 33 and to be hypothermic with a\ntemperature of 94 taken rectally. This was thought to be\nsecondary to hypoglycemia which may have progressed over several\nhours prior to assessment and her temperature returned to normal\nat 98 after her blood glucose was aggressively repleted. It was\nfelt that the patient likely had decreased metabolism of her\ninjected insulin in the setting of worsening renal failure , so ,\nher Lantus was decreased in accordance with a curbside\nconsultation with the diabetes management service. She will be\ndischarged home on a similar regimen to her home regimen simply\nwith a decreased Lantus dose down to 12 units nightly. She\nshould continue to monitor her fingerstick blood glucoses at\nhome. We were hesitant to change the types or timing of her\ninsulin during this hospitalization. I left that item to be\nfurther managed by her primary care provider after discharge:\n5. Hematologic: The patient has a chronic normocytic anemia\nfelt likely to be secondary to her chronic renal insufficiency.\nHer iron studies were rechecked on this admission and her iron\nstudies were also normal. She was continued on Aranesp through\nthis hospitalization and she is on Procrit as an outpatient and\nshe will continue on that with further discussion with the GGVH\nRenal Clinic after she is discharged.\n6. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient was fluid\nrestricted to 2 liters of fluid per day p.o. and potassium and\nmagnesium were repleted as needed and she was maintained on a\ncardiac diet. Prophylaxis was with Coumadin and Nexium.\nDISCHARGE PLAN: The patient will be discharged to home with VNA\nservices for some home physical therapy. She will follow up with\nher primary care provider Dr. Bublitz at MHS and also with the\nSRRH Cardiology Clinic and Renal Clinic. She should have her INR\nchecked within 4-5 days after discharge and her Coumadin\nrestarted when her INR is less than 2.5.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.\n2. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.\n3. Lipitor 80 mg p.o. daily.\n4. Folate 1 mg p.o. daily.\n5. Lantus insulin 12 units subcutaneous nightly.\n6. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.\n7. Metolazone 2.5 mg p.o. daily as needed for fluid retention as\ndirected by your physician.\n8. Multivitamin one tablet p.o. daily.\n9. Torsemide 100 mg p.o. q.a.m. at 50 mg p.o. q.p.m.\n10. Vitamin B12.\n11. Iron.\n12. Procrit 40 , 000 units subcutaneously every other week.\neScription document: 6-0072111 RFFocus\nDictated By: BURROW , KENNETH\nAttending: NOVAKOVICH , CURT\nDictation ID 1743355\nD: 1/16/06\nT:
