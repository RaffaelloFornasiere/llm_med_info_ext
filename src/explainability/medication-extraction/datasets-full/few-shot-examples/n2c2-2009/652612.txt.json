{"text": "RECORD #652612\n\n\n148900251 | EMHAHS | 69939492 | | 0604964 | 1/3/2003 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 3/17/2003 Report Status: Signed\n\nDischarge Date:\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: At the time of admission , altered mental status.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 73-year-old man with a\nhistory of prior delirious episodes as\nwell as a history of chronic diarrhea who , on the night before\nadmission , was noted to no longer recognize people at home and to\nbe confused about his location. On the morning of admission , the\npatient had had intractable explosive diarrhea. He does have a\nhistory of chronic diarrhea but the diarrhea on the date of\nadmission was significantly more severe than usual.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denied any chest pain , nausea ,\nvomiting , urinary tract infection , or decrease\nin his p.o. intake.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for congestive heart failure\nwith an ejection fraction of 50% , coronary\nartery disease status post five vessel coronary artery bypass graft\nin March 2002 , myelodysplastic syndrome , peripheral vascular\ndisease , gastrointestinal bleed status post right colectomy ,\nprostate cancer status post transurethral resection of the\nprostate , and macular degeneration.\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: At the time of admission included opium\ntincture , aspirin , Lomotil , Lasix , Ditropan ,\nLopid , Zocor , Atapryl , and iron.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: At the time of admission , patient was\nafebrile , his heart rate was 60 , his blood\npressure was 145/68 , and he was saturating 95% on room air. His\nphysical examination was notable for a jugular venous pressure at 5\ncm , moist mucous membranes , and soft , nontender , nondistended\nabdominal examination. On rectal examination , the patient was\nnoted to have guaiac positive brown stool.\nLABORATORY EXAMINATION: Head CT at the time of admission was\nnegative for any acute change , chest x-ray\nwas negative for any evidence of pneumonia , and the patient's EKG\nwas reviewed and shown to be without change from prior studies.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Neurological - The patient's mental status\nimproved quickly on admission. As noted above ,\nhis head CT was negative. It was thought that his mental status\nchanges were likely secondary to dehydration and were resolved at\nthe time of discharge.\n2. Pulmonary - During resuscitation of the patient's dehydration ,\nhe developed an O2 requirement although chest x-ray did not show\nany evidence for fluid overload or infiltrates. Occasional wheezes\nwere appreciated on examination and the patient's symptoms improved\nsignificantly with occasional nebulizer treatments of Albuterol and\nAtrovent. At the time of discharge , the patient was oxygenating\nwell.\n3. Cardiovascular - There were no acute cardiac issues during this\nhospitalization. Patient's losartan was held at admission given\nhis acute renal failure but other outpatient medications were\ncontinued.\n4. Hematology - The patient had a history of MDS and was a patient\nof Dr. Boivin . At the time of admission , the patient's hematocrit\ndropped 10 points but was thought to be likely due to hydration.\nSince that time , the patient's hematocrit has remained stable at\n35.\n5. Infectious disease - At the time of admission , the patient's\nblood cultures , urine cultures , and stool cultures were all\nnegative. Chest x-ray on March , 2003 was clear. It was felt\nthat the most likely etiology of his acute worsening of his\ndiarrhea was viral gastroenteritis. He also did receive a 7-day\ncourse of levofloxacin and Flagyl for empiric abdominal coverage.\nThe patient remained afebrile since the time of his antibiotics.\n6. Gastrointestinal - The patient is status post right\nhemicolectomy. He has a long history of diarrhea and presented to\nthis admission with explosive diarrhea and guaiac positive brown\nstool. At the time of admission , Kaopectate and Lomotil were\nstarted. On August , 2003 , he was noted to have increased\ndistention but a KUB was negative at that time for partial\nobstruction or impaction. There were concerns that the patient's\nabdominal symptoms might be secondary to ischemia so an MRI was\nobtained which showed proximal disease in the SMA , IMA , and celiac\nbut overall with good distal flow. An abdominal CT was obtained\nwhich showed a thick small bowel and dilated gallbladder with\nstranding but no evidence for ischemia. Gastrointestinal\nconsultation was obtained and on June , 2003 , and\nesophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which revealed grade IV\ngastritis. As a result , the patient was started on Nexium 40\nb.i.d.\n7. Renal - The patient has a history of chronic renal\ninsufficiency. The entire hospitalization , his BUN was in the\nfifties with a creatinine of 2.2. His FENA was less than 0.1% and\nthe patient was thought to be extremely intervascularly dry. With\ngentle hydration , the patient's creatinine eventually improved to\n1.9 at the time of this dictation.\nOPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Included esophagogastroduodenoscopy\nrevealing gastritis as discussed above.\nDISPOSITION: Diet includes that the patient is discharged on a\nfull p.o. diet. He was also instructed to supplement\nhis diet with high nutrition Boost shakes. Nutrition followed the\npatient closely during the admission and thought that he would need\nclose follow-up as an outpatient for his nutrition status.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Will be dictated in an Addendum to this\nDischarge Summary.\nFOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Venzor following\ndischarge.\nDictated By: LUCIO MAN GRAMS , M.D. VM675\nAttending: ERASMO N.
