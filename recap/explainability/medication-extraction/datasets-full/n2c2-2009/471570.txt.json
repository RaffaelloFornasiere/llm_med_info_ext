At age three , the patient was diagnosed with Wilms'\ntumor on the left , which was resected and subsequently treated with\nwide field radiation. The patient , thereafter developed\nradiation-induced tyroid cancer , at which time he underwent\nsubtotal thyroidectomy. In addition , the patient developed\nradiation nephritis in his remaining right kidney and pulmonary\nfibrosis. In May of 1997 , the patient underwent living related\ndonor renal transplantation for chronic renal failure. The patient\nwas at that point CMV antigen negative , however , the donor kidney\nwas CMV antigen positive. The patient underwent an uncomplicated\ntransplantation , however , the postoperative course was complicated\nby cytomegalovirus infection , presenting with diarrhea and\nrequiring hospitalization in February 1997. The patient was treated\nwith ganciclovir and subsequently maintained on Cytovene. The\npatient remained healthy until November 1997 , at which time he was\nagain admitted for a recrudescence of his cytomegalovirus\ninfection. In November 1997 , the patient presented with a\nthree-day history of fever to approximately 105 , anorexia , dry\ncough , fatigue , headache , dizziness , sweats , nausea and dyspnea on\nexertion. The patient was , at that point , treated with\nganciclovir , however his fevers persisted and he was discharged\nafter five days of therapy. At that time , the patient's CMV\nantigen test was negative , however , his shell vial cultures , both\nreturned as positive. The patient was maintained on ganciclovir\ntherapy in the post hospital course until May , 1997 , at\nwhich time his peripherally inserted catheter was removed.\nSubsequently , the patient has been healthy for approximately four\nweeks , then on November , 1998 , he noted a groin lump on the\nright. From November , 1998 , he noted feeling\nworse with fevers and chills , and a productive cough beginning on\nJuly , 1998. The patient's groin lump , subsequently , became\npainful , and he passed several loose bowel movements.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Wilms' tumor , ( 2 ) status post left\nnephrectomy with wide field radiation\ntherapy , ( 3 ) NCH renal disease status post living related donor\nrenal transplant from father in May 1997 , ( 4 ) hypertension , ( 5 )\ninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , ( 6 ) pulmonary hypertension ,\n( 7 ) hyperthyroid , ( 8 ) hyperparathyroid , ( 9 ) hypertriglyceridemia ,\n( 10 ) gout , ( 11 ) CMV infection in February 1997 and November 1997 ,\n( 12 ) history of perirectal abscess , ( 13 ) history of atrial\nfibrillation spontaneously converted in March 1998.\nALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\nADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Synthroid 150 mcg q.d. , NPH insulin 14\nunits q.a.m. , regular insulin p.r.n. ,\nnadolol 80 mg q.d. , Prednisone 10 mg q.d. , Neoral 100 mg b.i.d. ,\nCellCept 1 g b.i.d. , Axid 150 mg q.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. p.r.n. ,\nCoumadin 4 mg q.d.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives at home with his wife and has\nfour children. He denies alcohol or tobacco use.\nFAMILY HISTORY: No coronary artery disease. No history of cancer.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , but ill-appearing\nman in some respiratory distress , lying in\nbed. Temperature is 103 , heart rate 70 , blood pressure 160/80 ,\nrespirations 26 , oxygen saturation 90% on 4 L oxygen. HEENT\nexamination was notable for cushingoid facies and flushing was\nevident. No lymphadenopathy. The neck was supple , mucous\nmembranes moist and sclera were anicteric. Chest examination\nrevealed crackles on the right to half way up. Heart examination\nrevealed a noisy precordium with a prominent T2 and a 2/6 systolic\nejection murmur. Abdominal examination was negative. Extremity\nexamination revealed some slight swelling of the lower extremities.\nCutaneous examination was notable for evidence of thin subcutaneous\ntissues and development of a buffalo hump.\nLABORATORY DATA: White count of 11.3 with 46 polys , 36\nlymphocytes and 7 bands , hematocrit was 32.4 and\nplatelets were 143 , 000. Coagulation studies revealed a prothrombin\ntime of 15.8 and an INR of 1.8. Electrolytes were within normal\nlimits , blood urea nitrogen was 39 , creatinine was 2.5 , glucose was\n85 , calcium 10.2. Liver function tests revealed an alkaline\nphosphatase of 342 , total protein was 7.9 with an albumin of 3.9.\nCholesterol was 194 , triglycerides were 249. Cyclosporine level\nwas 303.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\n1. INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Surgery was consulted and the right groin\nabscess was drained and a wick was inserted. This wound was\ndressed and continued care was preformed by nursing staff. Blood\ncultures on admission revealed no growth and on hospital day two\nrevealed no growth. Wound cultures revealed few coagulase ,\nnegative staph. Antibiotics were initiated , first vancomycin ,\ngentamicin and Flagyl were initiated , however gentamycin was\nsubsequently discontinued and ceftazidime was initiated. The\npatient had one fever spike on hospital day one to 101.9. The\npatient subsequently had no fever spikes , however , on hospital day\nthree Levaquin was initiated and intravenous antibiotics were\ncontinued until hospital day four. At that point , the patient had\nbeen afebrile for 48 hours and the decision was made to switch the\npatient to oral antibiotics , including Levaquin and Augmentin. The\npatient continued to defervesce , his breathing improved , the pain\nin his right groin improved , dressing changes were continued and\nthe patient remained afebrile for more than 24 hours after\ninitiating oral antibiotics.\n2. CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient has a history of hypertension and\nhas been maintained on nadolol , recently requiring a doubling in\nhis dose from 40 mg q.d. to 80 mg q.d. He was admitted and placed\non 80 mg q.d. of nadolol , however , his blood pressures continued to\nrun up to 170 systolic and up to 110 diastolic. At that time , the\ndecision was made to initiate a second antihypertensive medication\nand nifedipine XL was chosen. He was maintained for two days at 30\nmg on this medication and his blood pressures subsequently\nstabilized at 130/80. The patient also carries a diagnosis of\npulmonary hypertension , presumed from the February 1997 , results\nof his echocardiogram. These results revealed a pressure gradient\nin the pulmonary arterial system , and on this admission a\nsubsequent echocardiogram was obtained to assess left ventricular\nfunction and his pulmonary vascular status. The results of this\nstudy revealed 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and 1+ mitral\nregurgitation , unchanged from prior studies and a pulmonary\narterial pressure of approximately 45 mmHg , also not notably\nchanged.\n3. PULMONARY: On admission , the patient reported a productive\ncough , in addition to difficulty breathing. This was evaluated\nwith a chest radiogram , which revealed possibility of a right sided\npulmonary process , corroborated on examination by evidence of\ncrackles half way up. The decision was made to rule the patient\nout for another flare of his CMV infection. Studies for CMV\nantigen and CMV from the buffy coat were sent and the final results\nrevealed a positive CMV antigen , but a negative buffy coat. The\npatient's pulmonary status improved on oxygen and on intravenous\nantibiotics. A induced sputum sample was obtained and studies were\nsent for atypical organisms including CPT , fungi , in addition to\nbacteria. All these studies were negative. In addition ,\nLegionella antigen was also negative. Prior to discharge , the\npatient's pulmonary status had returned to baseline and had\nentirely resolved.\n4. GASTROINTESTINAL: On admission , the patient reported multiple\nloose bowel movements. However , in his hospital course this did\nnot continue to be an issue. The patient also regained his\nappetite during the hospital course.\n5. HEMATOLOGIC: The patient was continued on his anticoagulation\nfor history of atrial fibrillation at 4 mg daily with an INR\nremaining in his goal parameters , which were set at 1.6-2.0. The\npatient however , has recently spontaneously converted to sinus\nrhythm and throughout his hospital course remained in sinus rhythm\nwith continuous monitoring.\n6. RENAL: On admission , the patient's creatinine level was 2.5\nand remained stable throughout his hospital course. His\ncyclosporine level was 303 on admission , on hospital day four , a\nlevel of 700 was obtained , however , this determined from a history\nthat this level had been drawn shortly after the patient had taken\nthe cyclosporine. During his hospital course , vancomycin levels\nwere followed. These levels reached a maximum of 19.8 on hospital\nday four , at which time intravenous antibiotics were discontinued.\n7. ENDOCRINE. The patient carries a history of multiple endocrine\nissues including hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism , diabetes\nmellitus , hyperthyroidism on thyroid replacement therapy following\nsubtotal thyroidectomy , and possibility of mineral corticoid\ndeficiency. The Endocrine Team was consulted. Thyroid studies and\nparathyroid studies were sent and revealed a TSH of 0.02 , a T4 of\n6.0 , a THPR of 1.47. On discharge , the patient's parathyroid 1 , 25\nvitamin D and 25 vitamin D were still pending. The Endocrine Team\nrecommended decreasing his Synthroid dose to a level of 125 mcg\ndaily. In addition , they recommended a bone densitometry study for\nevaluation of his bone mass following chronic maintenance on the\nsteroid therapy and a history of hyperparathyroidism. The team\nthought that the patient's previous question of a mineral corticoid\ndeficiency was likely due to his prior Cozaar therapy. They did\nnot fell it was necessary at this point to preform a cortizone\nstimulation study or to further assess this possibility of a\nmineral corticoid deficiency.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Augmentin 250/125 mg t.i.d. , Levaquin 250\nmg q.d. , CellCept 500 mg b.i.d. , Neoral 100\nmg b.i.d. , Prednisone 10 mg q.d. , Synthroid 125 mcg q.d. , INP\ninsulin 14 units subcu q.a.m. , regular insulin subcu p.r.n. , Axid\n150 mg q.d. , nadolol 80 mg q.d. , nifedipine XL 30 mg q.d. , Coumadin\n4 mg q.d. , iron sulfate 300 mg q.d.\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.\nDISPOSITION: To home.\nFOLLOW-UP: 1.
