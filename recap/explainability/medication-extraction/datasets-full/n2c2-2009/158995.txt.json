Ed. teacher had\na long history of ankle pain on the\nright side. He had a fracture as a child which was fixed with an\nopen reduction and internal fixation. He sustained a second ankle\nfracture a number of years later when he fell off a ladder and\nrefractured his ankle. Currently , he has pain on all movements of\nthe ankle while walking and performing any activity. The pain is\nprimarily in the ankle joint but also in his mid foot. He has been\ncontrolling his pain with Darvocet as well as intramuscular Tordal\n15 to 30 mg four times a day. He denies any other joint\ninvolvement and he denies any motor or sensory changes. PAST\nMEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for Insulin dependent diabetes\ncurrently managed with 32 units of NPH Humulin. He also has a\nhistory significant for hypertension. He denies bowel or bladder\ndysfunction , he denies coronary artery disease , dysrrhythmia , or\nmurmur , he denies peptic ulcer disease , and he denies thyroid gland\nabnormality. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for fracture\ntimes two of his right ankle status post open reduction and\ninternal fixation first time in 1965 and second time in 1988 , he\nhad herniorrhaphy in 1978 , he had drainage of a right thumb abscess\nin 1988 , and he has had septicemia treated at Vensperdon Hospital in\nFebruary and July of 1991. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: NPH Insulin\n32 units every morning , Procardia XL 90 mg q.a.m. , Lotensin 40 mg\np.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , potassium supplement , and then\nKetorolac 15-30 mg intramuscularly q.i.d. , and Darvocet N-100 one\nto four tablets q.d. ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.\nHe denies smoking history and he denies ethanol abuse. REVIEW OF\nSYSTEMS: Negative for dyspnea on exertion , shortness of breath ,\npalpitations , or anginal like symptoms. He does get bilateral leg\nedema. He has not had any evidence of neuropathy , retinopathy , or\nnephropathies associated with his diabetes.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well-developed 44 year old male who appears\nstated age. HEENT: Demonstrated pupils to\nbe equal and reactive , extraocular muscles intact , and oropharynx\nwas clear. NECK: Supple with full painless range of motion and\nthere was no goiter , adenopathy , or jugular venous distention.\nLUNGS: Clear to auscultation. CARDIAC: Demonstrated a regular\nrate and rhythm without significant murmur , rub , or thrill.\nABDOMEN: Soft , non-obese , and non-tender without evidence of\nhepatosplenomegaly. ORTHOPEDIC: Demonstrated that he had\napproximately 10 degrees of dorsiflexion , 10 degrees of plantar\nflexion with very limited subtalar motion , good mid foot motion but\nwith some pain on motion of the mid foot. There was pain during\nmovement of his tibiotalar joint. Specifically , there was little\npain with motion of the subtalar joint or the mid foot. He had\ngood dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses , he had normal\nsensation at the first dorsal web space , dorsum , and plantar\naspects of the foot , and the hindfoot appeared to be in neutral\nposition. There did not appear to be any supination or pronation\ndeformities. He had full painless range of motion at the hip and\nat the knee on the ipsilateral side.\nLABORATORY EXAMINATION: X-Rays demonstrated marked degenerative\njoint disease with a complete obliteration\nof the articular joint space in the lateral half of the joint.\nThere were also some degenerative changes in the mid foot. His\npre-operative laboratory evaluation demonstrated EKG with normal\nsinus rhythm and no evidence of ischemic changes , glucose was 133 ,\nBUN was 35 , creatinine 1.2 , potassium of 4.2 , liver function tests\nwere entirely within normal limits , hematocrit was 42.8 , white\nblood cell count was 9 , and the PT and PTT were 11.6 and 28.2\nrespectively. The patient's urinalysis was entirely clear for\nbacteria and negative for glucose and ketones.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted as a same day surgery\ncandidate with traumatic arthritis at the right\ntibiotalar joint and he underwent tibiotalar fusion with\ncross-cannulated AO screws and local bone graft. The procedure\ninvolved partial fibulectomy as well as a partial osteotomy of the\nmedial malleolus. The position of the ankle at the end of the\nprocedure was neutral dorsiflexion , plantar flexion , and neutral\nvarus/valgus. He had a general endotracheal anesthetic for failed\nsciatic nerve block , estimated blood loss was 200 cc , and total\ntourniquet time was 1 hour and 57 minutes. He received 2500 cc of\ncrystalloid intraoperatively and he tolerated the procedure well.\nPost-operatively , his motor and sensory examinations were intact\nwith regard to deep and superficial peroneal and posterior tibialis\nnerves. His Hemovac put out a total of 150 cc and was removed on\npost-operative day number one. He initially was kept in a\nposterior splint with anterior wings. This was changed on\npost-operative day two. The wound appeared to be clean and dry and\nhe was placed in a short-leg fiberglass cast since there was little\nswelling apparent. He had an X-Ray after placement of the cast and\nthe position of the ankle looked to be in neutral position and\nneutral varus/valgus. He was cleared by Physical Therapy\nambulatory , non-weight bearing , with use of crutches. He did not\nhave any difficulties with the cast , no significant swelling , and\nwas discharged on post-operative day three. The patient did have\nsome elevated temperatures which were attributed to atelectasis and\nwas encouraged to cough and deep breath.\nDISPOSITION: Patient will follow-up with Dr. Norman Dutko in\napproximately three weeks at which time the cast will\nbe changed and stitches removed. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The\nmedications that he was admitted on with the addition of Vicodan\none to two p.o. q.3-4h. p.r.n. , Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. as a\nsubstitute for the Tordal , and Halcion 0.125 to 0.25 mg p.o. q.h.s.\np.r.n.\nAS273/4278\nISSAC B.
