Two days prior to admission\nhere , she experienced shortness of breath at rest and some\nlightheadedness. At baseline , she becomes dyspneic after walking\n20 feet secondary to obesity and many years of smoking. She also\nnotes several days of headache and some questionable darkening in\nher visual fields bilaterally. She admits that her p.o. intake\nhas been rather poor since coming home secondary to anorexia and\nthat she has felt dehydrated. On review of systems , she also\nnotes chronic waxing and waning erythema of the right lower\nextremity which in recent days has worsened with accompanying\nswelling and mild tenderness , although her son says that it has\nbeen worse in the past. Also , she has noted loose stools since\n6/2/06. She denies chest pain , pleurisy , abdominal pain , blood\nin her stool or urine , dysuria , change in frequency , character or\nurination , or focal weakness. No new medications other than a\nrecent antibiotic course at Dale Skin Sonmu Medical Center completed there for\npneumonia. She has not taken her lisinopril or methadone in the\nlast two days. She has no sick contact. She saw her PCP on\n0/10/06 who found her to be hypotensive and hypoxic and then\nsent her to Ma County Hospital ED. Her family is not clear on her\ndischarge diagnosis , but they report that her kidney function was\nabnormal and she was dehydrated. She was not admitted. She then\ncame to the ED at Town Medical Center And Clinics for persistent shortness of\nbreath and dizziness. In the ED , her vital signs were that she\nwas afebrile , her systolic blood pressure was in the high 60's ,\nher heart rate was 110 , respiratory rate in the 30's , and O2\nsaturations were in the high 80's. She was given vancomycin ,\nLevaquin and gentamicin and 3 liters of normal saline. She was\naggressively given fluids and was started on Levophed for blood\npressure support. Her EKG was notable for low voltage on\nprecordial leads and borderline right axis deviation. Chest\nx-ray showed cardiomegaly , but otherwise clear. In the MICU , her\nblood pressure was stabilized on Levophed , but she was also noted\nto drop her blood pressure to the 70's when initiated on her home\nBiPAP settings.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nShe had endocarditis 20 years ago. She has obstructive sleep\napnea , on her home BiPAP , morbid obesity , and hypertension. She\nhad a right ankle injury more than 20 years ago during the motor\nvehicle accident , which was complicated by an ankle infection.\nShe has chronic right lower extremity pain and she is on\nmethadone. She had a Klonopin overdose. She had Enterobacter\npneumonia. She was treated with cefepime at that time ,\nquestionable the vancomycin. She has a questionable diagnosis of\nCOPD with her extensive smoking history. In a well state , her\nPCO2 was 49 , her O2 saturation is 89% , and she has also history\nof depression.\nMEDICATIONS AT HOME:\nLisinopril and methadone. She is not taking her lisinopril. She\nhas in the past taken lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide.\nALLERGIES:\nShe is allergic to penicillin and sulfa drugs.\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\nShe smoked half a pack a day for 30 years. No alcohol for three\nyears. No illicit drugs. She lives at home , but does not work.\nShe is on disability.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nShe was afebrile , heart rate in the 100's , blood pressure 130/80 ,\nrespiratory of 18 , and O2 saturation 95% on 8 liters of oxygen.\nShe was awake and alert and in no acute distress. She is\nanicteric , without pallor. She had a thick neck. Pulmonary:\nShe had decreased breath sounds and crackles at the bases\nbilaterally. Cardiovascular: She was tachy , regular , but\ndistant S4. JVP was difficulty to ascertain secondary to neck\nhabitus. Her abdomen was obese , + bowel sounds , nontender and\nnondistended. Extremities were without erythema of her legs , but\nwith mild swelling of the right lower ankle. The ankles were\nwithout swelling and with full range of motion. Neurologically ,\nshe was alert and oriented , but unfocused in conversation , moving\nall her extremities. Her strength was intact.\nLABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:\nPlease see LMR.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThis is a 49-year-old woman with a recent ICU stay at an outside\nhospital who presented with hypotension , tachycardia , and acute\nrenal failure. Presentation was most consistent with right\npulmonary embolus and right ventricular failure.\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\n1. Pulmonary/Vascular: There was initial concern for a PE given\nthe presentation of severe hypotension , tachycardia , and Aa\ngradient without evidence of infection or primary cardiac\ndisease. An echo showed a dilated RV with depressed RV function\nsuggestive of PE. Her initial PE scan was nondiagnostic\nsecondary to poorly timed contrast and motion of the patient. A\nVQ scan showed intermediate probability. She was started on\nheparin drip with a goal of 60 to 80. Her second PECT showed a\nsmall PE to the right upper lobe , but it was not large enough to\nexplain her dramatic presentation. The working hypothesis is\nthat there was a significant recanalization prior to this repeat\nCT which took place two days after the first CT. She was\ninitially on oxygen in the ICU. She was never intubated. She\nwas on face mask , and upon transfer to the floor , she was on\nnasal cannula 4 liters. Her O2 saturations were acceptable\nin-house , although she did desaturate to 90% when she took her\noxygen off a night. She multiple times refused BiPAP while in\nthe hospital , but she will go back on it when she returns home.\n2. Cardiovascular: She had a mild troponin elevation on\nadmission , likely secondary to RV strain. She had severe\nhypotension and was on two pressors. She was weaned off of these\non 4/15/06 , but did have an episode of hypotension when her\nBiPAP was started. She was given a little bit of low dose\ndobutamine and then she was weaned off of that on 3/6/06.\nRhythm: She has no active issues. We continued to hold her\nlisinopril while in-house. Her blood pressures were stable , but\nnot high enough to withstand on additional blood pressure\nlowering medication. It was discussed with her PCP that she\nperhaps will need this medication restarted as an outpatient.\nShe does have a history of severe hypertension.\n3. Renal: As she was in acute failure on admission with a\ncreatinine of 6.9 , it dropped to 0.5 , most likely this was due to\nprerenal azotemia and decreased renal perfusion in the setting of\nhypotension. Hypoperfusion of the kidneys in setting of\nhypovolemia and right heart failure resulting in decreased left\nventricular preload. Mucomyst and bicarb were given prior to the\nPECTs of her renal protection. She did not develop any\nadditional contrast nephropathy after her CT scans. Her\ncreatinine on discharge was 0.6.\n4. Endocrine: She had a normal increase in her cortisol level\nwith ACTH stimulation. Her fingersticks were monitored while she\nwas in-house and she never had any need for supplemental insulin.\n5. FEN: She was on a house diet.\n6. ID: She was empirically covered on admission with\nvancomycin , levofloxacin and gentamicin. Her antibiotics were\ngiven again on 10/16/06 and on 11/13/06. There was no evidence\nof an infection found , no fever , normal white count , with a\nnormal differential , normal UA , chest x-ray is without\ninfiltrate , and antibiotics were discontinued on 4/21/06. She\ncontinued to remain afebrile in-house without any evidence of\ninfection.\n7. Urology: She did complain of bladder spasms while having the\nFoley in place. She was started on Ditropan. She had multiple\nnegative urinalysis and urine cultures. Once the Foley was\ndiscontinued , she was able to void and she stopped having bladder\nspasms. She was started on Monistat for a yeast infection.\n8. Allergy: She did have an elevated eosinophilia on\npresentation and it was 4% on admission and increased to 8% on\n4/21/06. On the day of discharge , it was 7.5. There is no\nclinical evidence of allergy , rheumatic disease or parasitic\ninfection. Her obstructive lung disease may be of an asthma\nvariant , and there is the possibility she may need inhaled\ncorticosteroids as an outpatient.\n9. Heme: She was on unfractionated heparin for her presumed PE\nuntil 6/15/06 and then she was changed to Lovenox in the morning\nof that day on 120 mg subq. Her weight at that time was 157 kg.\nHer Coumadin , her initially given 10 , then a dose of 5 and then 2\ndose of 7.5. Her INR was therapeutic on the day of discharge at\n2.5. She will continue on the Lovenox for two additional days.\nHer INR will be monitored by Dr. Kid , her PCP.\n10. Psych/Addiction: We are continuing her methadone. It has\nbeen switched from 20 mg p.o. daily to 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. She was\nalso given a little bit of Ativan while in-house to help with her\nagitation and anxiety. She was initially given a little bit of\nHaldol , but that was discontinued on 8/4/06 and there was no\nadditional need for that. She did have a central line placed on\n4/18/06 , which was discontinued on 6/15/06 without any evidence\nof any line infection and without any problems. She was seen by\nSocial Work and PT. The patient refused to go to any sort of\nrehab or nursing home. It was decided that the patient would\nreturn home with skilled nursing and with PT as needed.\neScription document: 1-3509519 EMSSten Tel\nDictated By: MCMAIN , MITCHELL\nAttending: MCDUGLE ,
