TIA , who presents with dizziness , ataxia x 24H.\nPt denies CP , SOB , palpitations. Pt denies melana; BRBPR. NO new meds ,\nno N/V/F/C. This is unlike anything she has had in the past.\nIn the ED , labs were all within normal limits. While on a monitor she\nhad an episode of bradycardia to the 40s. Dr. Hilmer of\nthe EP service interogated the device and indicated that it was\nworking properly with no arrhythmias. Telemetry in the ED also did\nnot record the bradycardic episode , suggesting that perhaps it was an\nartifact. Pt's toxicology screen was negative. Her vitals in the ED w\nere 98.0 , 55 , 176/60 , 18 , 98%RA. No dysmetria; no dysdiadocokinesia;\nnegativ e Romberg's sign.\nHospital Course:\n1. CV: pt ruled out for MI; 24H telemetry showed no arrhythmias.\nPt's BB was held while in house because of worry about\nbradyarrhythmia , hypotension. Continued antihypertensive and CAD\ntreatment with with Cozaar , Lasix , Norvasc , Isosorbide , Digoxin ,\nAmiodarone. Pt is also on Coumadin , Plavix , and ASA , which was\ncontinued in house. Pt was discussed w/ pt's cardiologist , Dr.\nKallio who indicated this was not a new complaint in the patient and\nalso that she has been non-compliant in the past. PT was on Coreg but\nthis was held prior to admit for low BP's. Pt was hypertensive w/ SB\nP 150's while inpt but we will d/c pt off Coreg and defer to Dr.\nDoniel for reinstitution of beta blockade\n2. NEURO: pt's neuro exam was normal with no focal signs , and no signs\nof cerebellar dysfunction. Nevertheless given her significant vascular\nrisk factors there was concern for vertebral-basilar insufficiency.\nMRI/MRA was not possible given pt's AICD/pacer. Upon discussion w/\nteam CT/CTA were deferred given pt's renal insufficiency and risk of\ncontrast nephropathy coupled with our feeling that any findings would\nnot change pt management. This will be discussed with pt's PCP , Dr.\nBenedict Wichern .\n3. ENDO: pt was continued on home insulin regimen with coverage with\ninsulin sliding scale. Pt was found have a TSH of 158 FT4 1.8 , FT3 56.\nUpon discussion w/ pt , she revealed that she had previously been\ndiagnosed and begun on replacement but did not know what it was for and\nsubsequently stopped it on her own. Pt started on synthroid to be f/u\nw/endocrine. This may be the etiology of her symptoms.\n4. Prophylaxis: Nexium; pt was already anticoagulated with ASA , plavix\nand Coumadin.\n5. Disp: Pt to follow-up w/ Dr. Kishaba for managment of CHF/BP , and\nwith Dr. Blagg for f/u of potential neurovascular etiology of symptoms.\nPt to f/u with endocrinology for managment of hypothyroidism.\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS:\nDISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable\nTO DO/PLAN:\n1. continue levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. f/u endo for management\n2. f/u w/ Dr. Schryer for possible reinstitution of beta blockade and\nCHF/BP management\n3. f/u Dr. Hackborn for w/u potential vertebral-basilar insufficieny with\nrecognition of risk of iv contrast nephropathy vs utility of\ninformation\nNo
