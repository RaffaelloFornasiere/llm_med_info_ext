MD , PHD\nADDENDUM\nPlease note this is an addendum to the previously dictated\ndischarge summary #2200332.\nINTERIM HISTORY: In the interim , since the previously dictated\ndischarge summary , the patient has continued to progress from a\ncardiac standpoint.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: His hospital course by system from 9/24/05\nthrough the date of discharge is as follows:\n1. Ischemia: The patient had continued to remain stable from an\nischemia standpoint. He continues on aspirin and statin. A\nbeta-blocker has been added back to his regimen and was titrated\nto a dose of Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. The patient has not\nbeen started on an ACE inhibitor secondary to his elevated\ncreatinine at this time. He has had no further episodes of chest\npain.\n2. Pump: The patient's congestive heart failure regimen was\ntitrated. The patient continues on Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. and\nhydralazine 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. for after load reduction. He was\nrestarted on a low-dose beta-blocker at 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. as\nwell as digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o. q.o.d. The patient was\naggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix and Zaroxolyn\nfollowed by conversion to oral diuresis with torsemide at the\ntime of discharge. The patient will be followed by Dr. Rayford Hogenmiller in the Clevesa Irvca Sideenandri as well as by the\nCHF Service at Sher-ship Rimark's Medical Center . At the time of\ndischarge , the patient was felt to be nearing euvolemia with\nestimated dry weight of approximately 76 to 77 kg.\n3. Rhythm: The patient continued to have atrial flutter with a\nblock. His heart rate remained in the rate of 100 to 110 at the\ntime of discharge. He had decreased episodes of more rapid\ndysrhythmia following addition of beta-blocker and digoxin to his\nmedication regimen. He also continues on amiodarone at 200 mg\np.o. q.d. As mentioned , the patient was found to have atrial\nclot on transesophageal echocardiogram and thus was started on a\nheparin drip and transitioned on Coumadin. However , after a\nsubstantial discussion with the Congestive Heart Failure Service\nand the patient's outpatient CHF Care Team , it was felt that the\nrisks of Coumadin in this patient who has a history of\nsignificant noncompliance were greater than the known risk of\nthromboembolic disease in the setting of his known atrial clot\nand thus the patient was not continued on Coumadin\nanticoagulation. Rather , he was given aspirin and Plavix at full\ndoses. The use of Coumadin in this patient could be re-evaluated\nas an outpatient based on the patient's follow-up as deemed\nappropriate by his outpatient providers.\n4. Endocrine: The patient remained on stable diabetes mellitus\nregimen of Lantus 5 units q.p.m. and standing NovoLog 3 units\nq.a.c. as well as the NovoLog sliding scale. The patient's\ninsulin regimen can be adjusted as an outpatient and possibly\noral diabetes medications restarted.\n5. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from the pulmonary\nwith good oxygen saturations on room air at rest and with\nambulation.\n6. Renal: The patient's creatinine on the day prior to\ndischarge was 1.6 improved from the peak of greater than 2.\nRenal toxic medications were avoided. The patient had not been\nrestarted on ACE inhibitor , which could be done as an outpatient\nas his renal function stabilizes. His electrolytes were\nmonitored and repleted aggressively.\n7. Hematology: As mentioned , the decision was made not to\nanticoagulate the patient with outpatient Coumadin. He was\nstarted on aspirin and Plavix. Of note , the patient also had\ndecreased platelets in the setting of heparin anticoagulation and\nthus anti-P4 antibody was sent. This test is pending at the time\nof the dictation , but should be followed up by the patient's\noutpatient providers as it may input further treatment. In the\nmeantime , recommend no heparin products. As mentioned , the\ndecision was made by the CHF Team who will be following the\npatient as an outpatient not to continue Coumadin\nanticoagulation.\n8. Neuro: Of note , on the evening of 6/13/05 , the patient\ncomplained of left-sided blurry vision , which was new for the\npatient. He does have chronic right visual changes. In light of\nthe patient's known peripheral atherosclerotic disease and atrial\nclot , the patient was seen by the Stroke Team for a question of\nacute stroke. He had MRI at that time , which did show multiple\nold infarcts in the right frontal , right occipital , left\noccipitoparietal , left posterior frontal areas. There was ,\nhowever , no new stroke seen on the MRI. The left internal\ncarotid artery was not evaluated , not visualized on the MRI and\nthere was concern for left carotid artery occlusion versus\nstenosis. The patient declined any procedure such as carotid\nendarterectomy or carotid stenting for his possible carotid\nstenosis and due to this denial no workup with the CTA was done.\nIt was felt that because the patient would decline any\nintervention the risk of contrast in the setting of his acute\nrenal insufficiency would outweigh the benefits of the study.\nThe patient declined any intervention for his carotid arteries on\nseveral occasions. A carotid noninvasives were ordered and are\npending at the time of this dictation to evaluate the severity of\ndisease.\n9. Social: The patient's sister , Alexis Fernendez , is his health care\nproxy. The patient in her presence has declined coronary artery\nbypass grafting and heart transplant evaluation. The patient has\nalso declined further procedure for his probable carotid artery\nstenosis.\n10. Disposition: The patient will be discharged to the Com Medical Center for further rehabilitation. He will follow up with Dr.\nKyle Yandle in the T Las on 2/28/05 at 08:30 a.m. as well\nas with Dr. Clyde Chatampaya of Elmert Hospital\nCardiology 9/26/05. He also has a follow-up appointment with\nTRISTONTERN MEDICAL CENTER PCP , Raymond Banaag , on 10/3/05 at 01:50 p.m. The patient\nrequires substantial social support at this time , which is being\nprovided by his sister.\nMEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:\n1.
