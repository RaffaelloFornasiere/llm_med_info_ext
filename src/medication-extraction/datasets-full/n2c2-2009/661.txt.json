The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study\nof February , 2003.\nCC: Hypotension after dialysis\nHPI: 56 yo male with h/o ESRD , CAD , CHF ( EF 20-25% ) admitted for\nhypotension after HD. He was in his USOH until 2 days PTA when he\ndeveloped stomach upset , diarrhea , dry heaves , and a dry cough. He\ndenied recent travels , and had remote Abx use. At Stodun Hospital ,\nhe had 5.5 liters removed and afterwards his BP was 66/30. 1 liter of\nNS was given and his BP rose to 73/40.\nROS: Chronic PND , uses 1 pillow , gained 8kg in 2 weeks but compliant\nwith meds , no melena , no BRBPR\nPhysical Exam T 97 p85 BP 114/67-&gt;160/97 rr 16-24 89% RA\nChronically ill appearing , NAD\nNeck: Supple\nChest: Bibasilar rales\nCVS: palpable S3 , Lat displaced PMI , II/VI SEM at RUSB , JVP &lt; 7cm\nAbd: Soft NT ND , + BS , no HSM\nExt: Trace pedal edema , hyperpigmentation in sock distribution\nLabs: WBC 5 , TnI 0.37 , CK 153 , CKMB8.2 ( chronically elevated cardiac\nenzymes )\nEKG: NSR , 1st deg AVB , LAE , LVH , old TWI in 1 , L , V5 , V6 , more pronounced\nST dep in V5 than 6/4\nCXR: R pl effusion , CMG\nAssessment: Hypotension after dialysis in setting of GI\nupset/diarrhea/vomiting , likely was dehydrated. The BP rose after\nfluids and his current hypoxia is likely from mild pulm edema.\nAlthough chronically elevated cardiac enzymes , there is concern about\nnew ishemia , and concern for PE given hypoxia in ED.\nHospital course\n1. CVS: Ischemia: NSTEMI: contined medical management with asa , beta\nblocker , imdur , zocor , ntg prn. The CkMB peaked at 12 and Tni to 4. His\ncardiologist ( Dr Benisek ) recommended PET scan to assess for viable\nmyocardium and ischemia. His last stress test 1 year ago showed only\nscarring with no ischemia. In the past , pt's wife refused for him to go\nfor CABG. They are reconsidering this option currently.\nThe results of the PET scan are as follows:\n- A small region of myocardial scar/hibernation along with mild\nresidual stress induced peri-infarct ischemia in the distal LAD\ndistribution.\n- Moderate global LV systolic dysfunction.\n- The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study of February ,\n2003.\nThe family was called to stress the importance of follow up with\ncardiology ( They have missed appointments in the past )\nPump: ( EF 20-25% ) , increased enalapril to 10mg bid , BNP was sent and\npending and echo revealed EF 30% , Mod AI.\nRhythm: no events occurred on telemetry\n2. Pulm: monitored sats with fluid restriction. RA sats improved to\n97%\n3. Renal: HD MWF , home renal meds. He was dialyzed to a weight below\nhis previous baseline per cardiology recommendations. In the past he\nhas had elevated RH filling pressures after HD. The Ryi was\ncalled by the attendting renal physician ( Dr. Slemp ) about his goal\nweight.\n4. ID: Blood cx were no growth\n5. GI: He was continued on his home nexium\n6. Proph: SQ heparin was used for DVT prophylaxis\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: It is very important that you attend your follow up appointment with\nthe cardiologist , Dr Ivrin\nPlease take the medications listed above and do not take enalapril on\nmornings of dialysis\nPlease adhere to your dietary restrictions. If you gain more than 3 kg\nbetween dialysis sessions please restrict your fluid intake. The diet\nguidelines will be coordinated by the staff at Chapmed Gamette Medical Center\nDISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable\nTO DO/PLAN:\nsee above\nNo dictated summary\nENTERED BY: PASSINO , TERRY D. , M.D. ( EN8 ) 11/17/04 @ 11\n****** END OF DISCHARGE ORDERS ******\n[report_end]\n",
