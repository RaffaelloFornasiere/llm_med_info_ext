PAST\nMEDICAL HISTORY revealed the patient was diagnosed with dilated\ncardiomyopathy in 10-89. She was worked up at the Ingvid's Health Services with a conclusion of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy ,\nwork-up unavailable. The patient was discharged on Lasix , digoxin\nand an ACE inhibitor. In 20 of May , the patient was admitted to Orecross Medical Center after complaining of positional chest pain ,\nshortness of breath and fatigue. She was diagnosed with dilated\ncardiomyopathy and received an echocardiogram , which revealed large\nventricles , 2+ mitral regurgitation , 3+ tricuspid regurgitation. In\n7 of July , the patient underwent a bicycle exercise tolerance test and\nendured 10 minutes and 16 seconds , limited by fatigue. Peak heart\nrate was 104 , peak blood pressure was 156/80 , she had a few atrial\npremature beats and no ischemic ST-T changes. Her oxygen uptake\nwas 16.2 milliliters per kilogram per minute. In 4 of October , the patient\nunderwent right ventriculogram which showed ejection fraction 24%\nand global hypokinesis. On the day of admission , on 28 of May , the\npatient complained of 4 days of diarrhea , nausea , vomiting and\nmalaise , followed by sharp severe chest pain in the mid chest below\nthe left breast radiating to the back , which was relieved by lying\non the left and aggravated by leaning forward or lying on the\nright , also worsened by deep breathing and cough , and also with\nventral palpation. The patient claimed that the pain had never\ngone away in the past 12 hours , but again was aggravated by certain\npositions. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was significant for\ncardiomyopathy , hypertension , gastritis , ex-intravenous drug abuser\nfor 10 years , anemia , and recent crack cocaine use. MEDICATIONS ON\nADMISSION included Lasix , Enalapril and digoxin. ALLERGIES were no\nknown drug allergies.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese black woman in no\napparent distress. Blood pressure was\n162/100 , heart rate 90 , respiratory rate 24 , oxygen saturation 99% ,\nno pulsus. Eyes were pupils were equal , round , reactive to light ,\nextraocular movements intact , muddy sclera. Neck was supple ,\njugular venous pressure was 8 to 10 centimeters , carotids were 2+\nbilaterally. Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion\nexcept for a few bibasilar crackles. Heart showed normal S1 and\nS2 , no rubs , distant heart sounds , no murmurs were noted. Abdomen\nwas obese , soft , normal bowel sounds , she was comfortable with deep\npalpation diffusely. Extremities showed no edema. Rectal\nexamination was guaiac negative. Neurologic examination was\nnonfocal.\nLABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium was 137 , potassium 2.7 , chloride\n92 , bicarbonate 37 , blood urea nitrogen 7 ,\ncreatinine .9 , glucose 159 , AST 58 , creatinine phosphokinase 641 ,\nwith 23% myocardial bands. White count was 4.6 , hematocrit 31.5 ,\nplatelets 166 , 000 , ESR 60 , prothrombin time 11.3 , partial\nthromboplastin time 18. Chest x-ray showed a big heart with mild\ncongestive heart failure. The electrocardiogram showed T-wave\ninversions in I , II , F , L , V2 through V6 , consistent with a 1990\nelectrocardiogram done when she was complaining of positional chest\npain similar to the chest pain she is having now.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with the thought that\nher history was consistent with pericarditis , but\nwas also worriesome for ischemia given her elevated creatinine\nphosphokinase with myocardial band fraction of 23 , and her history\nof cocaine abuse. Her hospital course was consistent with\ncontinuation of her pain through the first day of hospitalization\ndespite and aggressive anti-ischemic regimen. It was found that\nhermyocardial band electrophoresis showed no myocardial band\nfraction detected , and it was decided that we would shift our\ntherapy to a more anti-inflammatory regimen to control her\npericarditis. At that time , Indocin was started and the chest pain\nresolved. With the resolution of her chest pain , the T-wave\ninversions corrected. The patient was transerred to the floor on\nIndocin 50 milligrams 3 times a day , aspirin , Bactrim , Enalapril\nand Carafate and remained without chest pain for the next 2 days.\nShe was also seen by the ACE team in consultation about her drug\nand alcohol problem , and it was decided that she would be\ndischarged on 28 of September , after arrangement for follow-up with the ACE\nteam.\nDISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. MEDICATIONS ON\nDISCHARGE included aspirin , Indocin 50 milligrams by\nmouth 3 times a day , Enalapril 10 milligrams by mouth each day ,\nCarafate 1 gram by mouth 4 times a day. The patient is to\nFOLLOW-UP with Dr. Dewitt A. Sisler .\nDictated By: MIRELES\nAttending: BERNARDO R.
