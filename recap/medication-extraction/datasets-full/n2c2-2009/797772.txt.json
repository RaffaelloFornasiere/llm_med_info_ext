Coronary artery disease. 2.\nBradycardia. 3. Diabetes mellitus. 4. Hypertension. 5.\nChronic renal insufficiency.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 74-year-old male with\nhistory of acute inferior myocardial infarction in February of\n1998 , with total occlusion of the mid circumflex , with fresh\nthrombus which was percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastied\nand stented. At catheterization in February , he was noted to have\n50 percent right coronary artery , as well. His hospital course at\nthat time was complicated by atrial fibrillation with Mobitz type I\nblock. The patient was loaded on procainamide. He also had\nseveral episodes of congestive heart failure. Echocardiogram in\nFebruary showed right ventricular dysfunction. At discharge , a\nsubmaximum exercise tolerance test , the patient went three minutes\nand twenty-one seconds without evidence of ischemia. On the day of\nadmission , the patient was in cardiac rehabilitation class when he\nbecame light-headed while seated and lost consciousness for\napproximately five seconds. He regained full consciousness. He\ndenied chest pain , shortness of breath , chest tightness , fever ,\nchills , nausea or vomiting. He had no urine or stool incontinence ,\nand no focal abnormal motor movements were noted by observers. A\ncode blue was called , and he went to the Emergency Department.\nElectrocardiogram showed old inferior Qs , PRWP , and slightly\nelevated T wave in V2 with left anterior fascicular block with\nheart rate of 49. Initial CK was 39 with a Troponin I of 0.02. He\nwas admitted to Wa T S for further workup and treatment.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease. 2. Diabetes\nmellitus on insulin. 3. Hypertension. 4. Status post bilateral\nknee replacements. 5. Asbestos exposure. 6. Chronic renal\ninsufficiency.\nALLERGIES: Allergies to penicillin.\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Aspirin 325 mg q.d. 2. Captopril\n75 mg t.i.d. 3. NPH insulin 18 q.a.m. and 8 q.p.m. 4.\nProcainamide 500 mg t.i.d. 5. Simvastatin 20 mg once a day.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: A 40 pack year history , quit four years ago.\nDenies alcohol.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: A well-appearing gentleman , in\nno apparent distress. Vital signs , afebrile , heart rate 50 , blood\npressure 111/87 , respirations 16 , 98 percent on two liters. HEENT ,\natraumatic , normocephalic , oropharynx clear. Neck , carotids 2+ , no\nbruits , no cervical adenopathy with the exception of a 2.0\ncentimeter node in the occipital region. Chest , clear to\nauscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular , bradycardic , regular\nrate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2. Abdomen , positive bowel sounds ,\nsoft , non-tender , nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly.\nExtremities , no edema , no other lymphadenopathy. Neurological\nexamination , alert and oriented x three , non-focal.\nLABORATORY DATA: Admission laboratory is significant for a\ncreatinine of 1.6 and a potassium of 5.1. Blood count were white\nblood cell count 5.5 , hematocrit 44.6 , platelets 233. CK 39 ,\ncardiac Troponin I 0.02.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 74-year-old male with history of\nacute inferior myocardial infarction in February , complicated by\npostmyocardial infarction atrial fibrillation and Mobitz type I\nblock , now admitted following syncopal episode. The\nElectrophysiology Service was consulted and prior to\nelectrophysiology study the patient underwent evaluation for\npossible ischemic causes of an arrhythmia. He was initially ruled\nout for myocardial infarction by serial enzymes and\nelectrocardiograms. On standard Bruce protocol exercise tolerance\ntest mibi , May , 1999 , the patient went four minutes and\nthirty seconds , maximum heart rate 121 , maximum blood pressure\n210/85. He had typical chest pain for angina and chest tightness\nat peak exercise which was relieved with rest. There were no\nelectrocardiogram changes. He remained in sinus rhythm. Mibi\nimages showed a mixed MI in basilar half of the inferior wall in\n4/20 segments , mild peri-infarct ischemia in 3/20 segments in the\nright coronary artery territory. He had normal left ventricular\nfunction , normal left ventricular volume , and global systolic left\nventricular function with left ventricular ejection fraction of 55\npercent , wall motion abnormalities and severe inferior wall\nhypokinesis and mild septal hypokinesis. Based on the results of\nthe exercise tolerance test mibi , the patient underwent cardiac\ncatheterization on May , 1999 which revealed a normal left\nmain , left anterior descending artery with minor irregularities ,\nleft circumflex with 90 percent in-stent restenosis in proximal\nsegment with a dominant left circumflex , and right coronary artery\nwith a mid 50 percent lesion. The patient underwent successful\npercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the in-stent\nrestenosis. He was subsequently continued on aspirin. The\nElectrophysiology Service recommended that the patient's\nprocainamide be stopped. Of note , the patient's QT interval was\nnot prolonged while on procainamide. After the procainamide was\nheld , the patient underwent electrophysiology study on March ,\n1999 revealing normal sinus node recovery time , impaired AV nodal\nconduction , no inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia , and no\ninducible supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation. The\npatient was discharged to home with plans to follow-up with his\nprimary cardiologist , perhaps with a Holter or event monitor.\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: 1. Aspirin 325 mg q.d. 2.\nCaptopril 75 mg t.i.d. 3. NPH Humulin insulin 18 units q.a.m. and\n8 units q.p.m. 4. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. 5. Vitamin\nE. 6. Simvastatin 20 mg q.h.s.\nFOLLOW-UP: The patient will be followed up by his primary care\ndoctor , in particular the posterior cervical single lymph node\nshould be followed up by his primary care physician.\nDictated By: WOODROW BEAUDINE , M.D. UU390\nAttending: TYREE R.
