Cardiovascular :\nThe patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and thought likely secondary to diastolic dysfunction secondary to hypertension .\nThe patient was also found to have pulmonary hypertension .\nShe ruled out for myocardial infarction with 3 negative enzymes .\nOn admission , she was diuresed with Lasix and was negative 1-2 liters per day for several days .\nThe diuresis was backed off when her bicarbonate increased from 36 to 39 .\nShe was restarted on 20 mg p.o. q day prior to discharge .\nHer lipids were checked with a total cholesterol of 110 , triglycerides 59 , HDL32 , LDL 64 .\nThe patient had a D-dimer greater than 1000 with lower extremity non-invasive studies which were positive for a small right common femoral clot .\nIt was unclear whether this was old or new .\nA TTE showed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild mitral regurgitation , left atrial enlargement , mild tricuspid regurgitation , pulmonary artery pressures of 44 plus right atrial pressure .\nThere was an intra-atrial shunt from the right to the left through a patent foramen ovale .\nChest CT was a poor study but did not show a pulmonary embolus .\nThe patient had subsequent dobutamine MIBI which was positive for inducible ischemia in the distribution of posterior descending coronary artery and posterolateral coronary artery with a small to medium perfusion defect in the inferolateral wall and basal inferior wall which was partially reversible .\nThe cardiology service saw the patient and recommended medical management only without catheterization .\nHer blood pressure was high so Captopril was titrated up to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. .\nShe will be discharged on Lisinopril with further titration as an outpatient .\nShe is on hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q day .\nHer atenolol was stopped due to bradycardia on admission but this may be restarted as an outpatient in gentle doses with careful monitoring of heart rate .\nShe is on an aspirin .\nShe will be discharged on Lasix 20 mg for continued control of her edema .\n2. Pulmonary ;\nPulmonary hypertension as seen on echocardiogram .\nUnclear whether there are chronic pulmonary embolus but did have positive test for deep venous thrombosis and will be treated with Coumadin .\nAn ABG was done which showed pH 7.34 , pCO2 78 , pO2 92 on 2 liters .\nHer bicarbonate peaked at 39 and generally is in the 36-38 range .\nShe has severe sleep apnea and falls asleep midsentence .\nShe has episodes of not breathing .\nBIPAP was attempted for 3 nights in a row and the patient did not tolerate this .\nShe will need pulmonary function studies as an outpatient as these were not done in the hospital .\nThe pulmonary team saw the patient and only recommended the above testing .\nShe needs home oxygen and is currently at 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen .\n3. Infectious disease :\nEvidence for cellulitis on her legs , likely due to distention from edema and poor perfusion .\nShe was originally started on cefazolin which was then changed to Keflex with good improvement .\nShe will need to continue for at least 10 more days or as clinically indicated by the course of her cellulitis .\n4. Hematology :\nD-dimer in the emergency room was greater than 1000 and a right common femoral clot was seen .\nThis clot was small and it was questionable as to whether it was old or new .\nShe was started on anticoagulation given the positive D-dimer .\nChest CT was nondiagnostic but did not show pulmonary embolus .\nIt was a poor study .\nHeparin was maintained during her hospital course and then Lovenox was started .\nHer dose was increased to 7.5 mg q day the day prior to discharge .\nShe will be discharged on this dose in addition to 1 day of Lovenox .\nDischarge INR 1.8 .\nGoal INR is 2.0-3.0 .\n5. Fluids / electrolytes / nutrition :\nLow salt diet .\nLow cholesterol , low fat diet .\n", "file": "36.xml", "annotations": [{"date_value": "2002-02-01", "line": 2, "text": "02/01/2002"}, {"date_value": "2002-02-08", "line": 4, "text": "02/08/2002"}]}
