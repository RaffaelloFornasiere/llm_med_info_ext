She also had p.r.n. of\nTylenol , ducolox , Mylanta , lactulose , Seroquel 100 mg , prednisone\n50 mg , and Dilaudid 1 mg.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Divorced with two children. No alcohol use\nrecently.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Father died of a MI at 73. Her mother died in\nher 80s of emphysema.\nLABORATORY DATA: The patient had a creatinine of 1 , her ALT was\n25 , AST was 35 , her hematocrit was 33 , her white count was 6.6 ,\nand her platelets were 241 , 000. She had normal differential.\nHer albumin was 3.5. Her urinalysis was dark , with 3+\nleukoesterase , negative nitrates , greater than 200 white blood\ncells per high peripheral , 2-4 red blood cells per high\nperipheral , 1+ bacteria. Her EKG showed a sinus rhythm of 100.\nHer left bundle branch block with a QTc of 500 , but no change\ncompared to baseline.\nHer head CT showed an old right middle cerebral artery implant.\nHOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for initial\npresentation with somnolence and altered mental status with one\nhypotensive blood pressure by EMS , but subsequently no\nhypotension in the absence of fluid resuscitation. Her urine\nculture appeared to indicate an infection , and so she was covered\nwith antibiotics initially. It was also determined that she had\na significant polypharmacy and enumerable sedating medications at\nher rehabilitation and there was suspicion that the medications\ncontributed to her initial presentation of somnolence and altered\nmental status.\n1. Infectious disease: The patient was initially treated with\nvancomycin for a presumed repeated MRSA UTI. However , her urine\nculture did not grow any bacteria , it only drew out yeast. Thus ,\nshe was transitioned over to a ciprofloxacin 700 mg p.o. b.i.d.\nregime for a total of 12 days for a presumed urinary tract\ninfection.\n2. F/E/N: She was tolerating oral food and medications and a\nNutrition consult was obtained. She had calorie counts which\nshowed adequate intake. She did not have any other metabolic\nabnormality that required correction.\n3. Cardiovascular: The patient's primary cardiovascular\nabnormality was a prolonged QTc which occurred in the setting of\nprior use of Haldol and other antipsychotics for behavioral\nmodification. Her QTc was monitored with serial EKGs. The\nlongest it had reached was 530 ms. Haldol was discontinued in\norder to preserve the QTc. In addition , she was given some\namounts of Seroquel and her QTc was continued to be monitored.\n4. Heme/Oncology: The patient has a history of stage III\nnon-small cell lung cancer status post XRT and chemotherapy and\nis followed by her outpatient oncologist , as well as the\noutpatient psychosocial oncology social worker , as well as the\npsychosocial oncology physician whose name is Chet Nave .\n5. Neurological: The patient is status post both a large right\nMCA stroke , as well as a right-sided carotid endarterectomy from\na previous admission. Her neurological deficits are consistent\nwith her prior neurological deficits. Specifically , they include\na left-sided hemiparesis , as well as agnosia on the left side.\nHer mental status included intermittent disorientation. She was\ngenerally at her best , alert and oriented to herself , as well as\nher age , as well as her location in the Domo Ings Hospital .  However , she would intermittently loose track of where\nher location was and believed that she was in Naimas West Hospital , not in\nthe hospital. She was also intermittently confused. She also is\ncomplicated , given her histories of seizures and stroke. It was\nconsidered initially that her altered mental status was due to\npolypharmacy. However , her sedating medications were\ndiscontinued including her Reglan was discontinued as well as her\nbaclofen , Dilaudid and trazodone. Her Cymbalta was continued per\nthe recommendations of the Psychiatry consult. The psychiatric\nconsultants also suggested a one-to-one sitter. At no time was\nthe patient actively suicidal or homicidal. It was also later\ndecided that her Dilaudid would be discontinued. In addition ,\nher standing Seroquel was made p.r.n. In addition , the\npatient's family also suggested that the patient's base mental\nstatus did not improve despite removing all the medications. At\nthis point , a Neurology consult was obtained. This Neurology\nconsult is pending at the time of this dictation and will be\nreported in a later dictation. Given the patient's history of\ncomplex seizures and olfactory hallucinations , she was continued\non her Lamictal , as well as her Cymbalta , which was for her\nhistory of depression.\n6. Pain: The patient's pain in her left hand existed and she\nwas treated with tramadol and Tylenol for this pain. She could\nnot specifically describe this pain.\n7. Endocrine: The patient was maintained on Novolog sliding\nscale for diabetes. She was also continued on a replacement dose\nlevothyroxine for her history of Graves' and a history of\nradioiodine ablation. For behavioral modification , as well as\nfor intermittent agitation and disorientation , the patient was\nmaintained on p.r.n. Seroquel 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , as well as\nZydis 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. This was titrated from standing to\np.r.n. over the course of her hospitalization in order to try to\ndecrease any sedating medications that may be altering her\nalertness and orientation.\nNOTE: This dictation will be addended at a later date with\ndischarge medications , as well as further hospital course and the\npatient's neurological state , as well as any follow up that is to\nbe planned.\neScription document: 1-9584080 SSSten Tel\nDictated By: OCHILTREE , RYAN\nAttending: LAMORE , SERGIO\nDictation ID 6454134\nD: 7/3/06\nT: 7/3/06\n[report_end]\n", "annotations":
