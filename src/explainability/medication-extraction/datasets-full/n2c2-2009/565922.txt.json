CT scan of the head on\n10/6/98 showed low density area present in the posterior limb of\nthe left intracapsular capsule consistent with an infarct.\nOtherwise , no significant abnormality was seen. Mild age\nappropriate involutional changes were present.\nLABORATORY: Showed a glucose of 353 , sodium 138 , potassium 4.9 ,\nchloride 98 , CO2 28 , BUN 33 , creatinine 1.1 , calcium\n10.3 , magnesium 2.0 , troponin 0.09. White count 8.4 , hematocrit\n39.8 , platelet count 367 , 000. PT 12.1 , PTT 19.5. INR 1.0.\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. Lofstrom is a 57-year-old female with a\npast medical history of hypertension ,\ndiabetes mellitus , multinodular goiter , arthritis and questionable\nrecurrent bouts of generalized weakness who was admitted for new\nonset of right sided weakness ( three days prior to admission ) ,\nright leg numbness and weakness , right arm clumsiness followed by\ndysarthria.\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:\n1. NEUROLOGY: The patient was felt to have a probable subcortical\nstroke of the left hemisphere with preservation of the speech\nprocessing abilities with dense motor and sensory involvement.\nThis was felt to potentially represent an MCA branch occlusion with\nincreased edema versus a large lacuna. In addition , given her\nhistory , the team was unable to rule out the possibility of an\nembolic event. Therefore , the patient was admitted and ruled out\nfor a myocardial infarction. Her CKs were 25 , 37 , 37 and 32. She\nwas placed on a cardiac monitor with no evidence of arrhythmia.\nshe was placed on subcu heparin and started on full dose aspirin\n325 milligrams p.o. q.d.\nIn order to further work up the etiology for stroke , the patient\nhad an echocardiogram done which revealed evidence of concentric\nLVH with preserved systolic function , calculated ejection fraction\nof 55%. Other than nonspecific septal abnormality , there was no\nevidence of regional wall motion dysfunction. There were early\nchanges of mitral annular calcification present , some increased\nexcursion of the mitral leaflet , but this is associated with only\ntrivial regurgitation. Trileaflet aortic valve without\ndysfunction. One plus tricuspid regurgitation. Peak doppler flow\nvelocity across the tricuspid valve reached 2.5 meters per second\nconsistent with normal right heart systolic pressures. There was\nno evidence of effusion. In addition , the patient underwent\ncarotid noninvasive studies which revealed no evidence of\nhemodynamically significant disease in either carotid artery with\nthose arteries having minimal plaque and 1-25% stenosis. In\naddition , the patient had an MRI/MRA to further evaluate potential\nlesions. On MRI there was a focal area of increased T2 signal in\nthe posterior limb of the left internal capsule , close the genu.\nThis area demonstrated restricted diffusion on EPI diffusion ,\nweighted sequence. A similar smaller area of signal abnormality\nwas noted in the left globus pallidus adjacent to the left internal\ncapsule abnormality. These areas represent subacute infarctions.\nThe ventricles and sulci were minimally prominent , consistent with\nthe patient's age. There was no other signal abnormality noted.\nMajor vascular flow voids were normal. There was no mass or mass\neffect. Three D , TOF MRN angiogram on the circle of Willis and its\nmajor tributaries did not demonstrate any abnormality. Incidental\nnote was made of a dominant right vertebral artery. The formal\nimpression revealed subacute infarcts involving the posterior limb\nof the internal capsule on the left as well as the left globus\npallidus. Unremarkable MR angiogram on the circle of Willis.\nIn addition , given the patient's history of polymyalgias , an ESR\nand C-reactive protein were obtained. The ESR was 46. The\nC-reactive protein was 1.13. The stroke service was asked to\ncomment on the possibility of a vasculitic process. In addition ,\nthe patient's primary rheumatologist was consulted as well. The\npatient's primary rheumatologist felt that the patient's stroke was\nmost likely due to small vessel disease associated with diabetes\nand hypertension. He felt there was no evidence for a vasculitis.\nHe therefore suggested to continue aspirin , but in higher doses to\nalleviate her left shoulder pain. The patient did not feel that\nshe had any vasculitic process. They therefore recommended\ncontinuing aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d. , checking a serum\nhomocystine which remains pending at the time of this dictation ,\nreviewing her carotid studies ( mentioned above ) , and continue with\nphysical therapy occupational therapy and speech therapy.\nPT and OT were consulted as well as Speech Therapy.\nIn addition to continuing the patient on aspirin , continuing subcu\nheparin while the patient was immobile , the patient's\nantihypertensives were held in order to maintain a systolic blood\npressure between 140-160 and a diastolic blood pressure between\n85-90 for the first ten days following her stroke. For the first\nfew days , the patient was kept in a lying position as much as\npossible and her activity level was gradually increased to the\npoint where she was participating in full PT/OT. At the time of\nthis dictation , the patient's Norvasc continued to be held with\nexcellent control of her blood pressure between systolic of\n140-160. It should not be reinitiated until roughly ten days after\nher stroke.\nThe patient had relatively poor return of function during her\nhospital stay , but was felt to be a good candidate for potential\nrehabilitation. Therefore when her medical issues were stable , she\nwas considered ready for transfer to a rehabilitation facility in\nan attempt to further improve her neurologic function. As noted\npreviously , the patient's antihypertensives should be reinitiated\ngradually with a goal systolic blood pressure between 140-160 with\na diastolic blood pressure of 85-90 to be initiated roughly ten\ndays from the time of her stroke ( presented on 10/6/98 ). As noted\nby the work up , the patient had no evidence of an embolic source\nfor her stroke and her carotid studies were unremarkable.\n2. RHEUMATOLOGIC: As noted , the patient has a long history of\ndiffuse arthritic complaints. She had her sed rate and C-reactive\nprotein checked. Rheumatology was consulted who felt that her\nstroke was not consistent with a vascular process. They did\nrecommend checking a urinalysis to check for red blood cells and\ncasts. Her urinalysis showed no protein , no blood , 0-2 red blood\ncells , no casts. Only other recommendation was to continue aspirin\nand consider higher doses to alleviate left shoulder pain. In\naddition , recommended avoiding nonsteroidals while the patient was\non aspirin.\n3. ENDOCRINE: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and\nhad not taken her insulin for several days prior to admission. The\npatient was placed on her regular insulin schedule as well as a\nsliding scale. The patient's blood sugar has ranged from the 150\nto the high 200s. As the patient's diet returns to baseline , she\nmay require adjustments of her NPH and regular insulin doses. In\naddition , the patient's Premarin was held during this admission and\nfurther therapy should be decided by the patient's follow up\nneurologist.\n4. FLUIDS , ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: The patient initially\nappeared somewhat dehydrated on admission and was therefore\nrehydrated with IV fluids. She had good resolution and returned to\nbaseline of her BUN and creatinine. She was eating well at the\ntime of discharge. Close observation was paid to her electrolytes\nincluding her potassium. Her electrolytes should be periodically\nmonitored at least once a week at rehabilitation. She does have a\nhistory of hyperkalemia and should be watched carefully for this.\n5. SOCIAL WORK: The patient initially made a comment to the\nMedical Team that she had been abused by her husband. The social\nworker was consulted and asked to see her regarding this issue of\nspouse abuse. It is true that her husband had hit her in the\nforehead with a baseball bat in the past. He died several years\nago and no further abuse history could be elicited since his death.\nShe currently has two supportive children.\nThe patient was considered stable and ready for discharge to a\nrehabilitation facility. When the date of her transfer is made\navailable , her discharge medications will be dictated along with\nfollow up.\nDictated By: RODGER FALIS , M.D. JL81\nAttending: JUAN AMISANO , M.D. RW2  CK149/6034\nBatch: 5491 Index No. PGONI565Z D: 3/29/98\nT: 6/16/98\n[report_end]\n", "annotations": [{"medication_name": "insulin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "25"}, {"medication_name": "hydrochlorothiazide", "medication_dosage": "12.5 milligrams", "mode": "", "frequency": "once a day", "line": "39"}, {"medication_name": "taxol", "medication_dosage": "28 milligrams", "mode": "", "frequency": "once a day", "line": "40"}, {"medication_name": "norvasc", "medication_dosage": "5 milligrams", "mode": "", "frequency": "once a day", "line": "40"}, {"medication_name": "trazodone", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "41"}, {"medication_name": "premarin", "medication_dosage": "0.625 milligrams", "mode": "", "frequency": "once a day", "line": "41"}, {"medication_name": "regular", "medication_dosage": "12 units", "mode": "", "frequency": "in the morning", "line": "42"}, {"medication_name": "nph", "medication_dosage": "50 units", "mode": "", "frequency": "in the morning", "line": "42"}, {"medication_name": "regular", "medication_dosage": "14 units", "mode": "", "frequency": "in the evening", "line": "43"}, {"medication_name": "nph", "medication_dosage": "10 units", "mode": "", "frequency": "in the evening", "line": "43"}, {"medication_name": "ansaid", "medication_dosage": "100 milligrams", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "b.i.d. p.r.n.", "line": "44"}, {"medication_name": "baby aspirin", "medication_dosage": "81 milligrams", "mode": "", "frequency": "once a day", "line": "45"}, {"medication_name": "heparin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "subcu", "frequency": "", "line": "99"}, {"medication_name": "aspirin", "medication_dosage": "325 milligrams", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.d.", "line": "99"}, {"medication_name": "aspirin", "medication_dosage": "higher doses", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "140"}, {"medication_name": "aspirin", "medication_dosage": "325 milligrams", "mode": "p.o.", "frequency": "q.d.", "line": "143"}, {"medication_name": "aspirin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "148"}, {"medication_name": "heparin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "subcu", "frequency": "", "line": "149"}, {"medication_name": "antihypertensives", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "150"}, {"medication_name": "norvasc", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "156"}, {"medication_name": "antihypertensives", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "165"}, {"medication_name": "aspirin", "medication_dosage": "higher doses", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "177"}, {"medication_name": "aspirin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "180"}, {"medication_name": "insulin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "182"}, {"medication_name": "regular insulin", "medication_dosage": "sliding scale", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "183"}, {"medication_name": "nph", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "186"}, {"medication_name": "regular insulin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "186"}, {"medication_name": "premarin", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "", "frequency": "", "line": "187"}, {"medication_name": "fluids.", "medication_dosage": "", "mode": "iv", "frequency": "", "line": "192"}]}
